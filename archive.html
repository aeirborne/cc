      Badge any great literature recommendation pls??? Not the classic novels but more like ao3 ships, better if it revolves around [literature prof, student at uni setting]...cuz I apparently need to bring back my lost love for this subject as I pissed off my uni prof saying in what way literature is saving lives? And they deadpanned looked at me as if I am the next on their kys list not to mention the lecture of 638 words that summarise "I can't believe you think like this" 😭 lost count how many times I reread your fics so this is the only way to cope and possibly be feeling less suicidal myself ಥ‿ಥ --- you know who it is.... your ardent fan Suzy.

      this is such an amazing story, miss. i love the colour metaphors even though some really confuses me lmao. and the parallels between the past and future got me screaming (internally, the barista didnt need another worry). evergreen, which i usually see in a more fluffy? setting and this story does that too but i love that it refers to a moodtracker of all thing XD and not lose it meaning too so i think its really a clever use ;A; <br><br>you know maybe one day i’ll read this again and then i might relate more to their growth, maybe? instead of jisoo’s struggle, which admittedly, hit too close to home. been doing some self deprecation myself these days and probably not the best time to review this because welp, more trauma dumping in your cc ;A;<br><br>i guess when you’re struggling with self esteem, some part of you just believe that you’re unlovable, and you believe its hard for people to love you (and it probably is hard to some extent ?) so it will just hurt both sides. soo yep, need to work on that.<br><br>i really love the idea that growth is not feeling happy all the time, but letting yourself be human and feel what you feel. it recently has been on my mind, that i feel envious when i see people be vulnerable, honest with their emotions. but its also scary, because its… vulnerable, you know? like its easy to get hurt.<br><br>also, special mention to the crack on seungcheol’s wall that might or might not be an imagery of something broken in jisoo/seungcheol or in their relationship that seungcheol tried to cover clumsily with correction tapes. i might be reading on it too deeply, but i like the crack, so i will put my own meaning to it.<br><br>thank you, miss, for writing this :) there are so many lines that spoke to my heart, and i’ll probably remember it from time to time. thank you so much, i love youuuu

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> re: sage greens. it may depend on the person but if you look up the shade, it's a muted green colour, less saturation and lower contrast. i associate it with spring :) the season after harsh winters, and a desolation of life. a new beginning, per se. or a promise of happiness, yet not quite there. or perhaps just being content with the present, a quiet buzz of calm and comfort.<br><br>so yes, it can be soft happy days :) when i said i thank people for the patience eclipsing my sage greens, it means i'm grateful for the patience everyone has as i overcome my winters and transition to fresh beginnings, which can be quite unsteady as there's a susceptibility to regress. sage greens for me is unstable territory, but a lot of kind souls have and had always helped me through it, eclipsing the instability of it :)

(: you never know when one stranger could affect you even with just one conversation.<br><br>re: perfectionism. it goes hand in hand with anxiety, procrastination, and the fear of being seen and perceived xD what a complex human machine we are.

      The luckiest and unluckiest person to ever exist in cf is Jisoo. Boy got a whole line of partners assigned for him and whoever reigns the throne gets him as a husband he can even be betrothed to hansol as he's the last heir as of knowing and it all started with seungcheol 🫢 everyone was searching for him with his English name which mah boy didn't even know existed😂 they think he poses a threat to the kingdom whilst he's busy making coffees and getting threat from the cafe owner every 2 business days. The reason he is unlucky because life ain't smiling at him his whole life he lived without a father's presence got beaten up by sungjin and boom one day he is travelling by a royal car gets called "Your Grace" the very friend he joked with on appearing on news and all and days after he will be the one in tow with the other castle fires indeed🥲
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> or he could simply have the betrothment ineffective after six months hehe (and cause a national scandal but we won't talk about that). i think jisoo's already too riddled with his father's past to have the betrothment on top of his mind. at the end of the day it will always be jiwon's safety and donghyun's memories for him.

      If you are seeing this then hi~ <br><br>Coming from a reader who read every svt fics if yours; evergreen, glimpse of us, castle fires and swwa and to talk about what each of this fics taught me is to come out as a stronger and bolder person. Your characterisations, their stories, their room for development and how you focus more on their life story rather than smut and fluff is that secret ingredient which leaves a lasting impresaion of those words. As if we are growing older with evergreen seungcheol or castle fires jisoo taking up on life living everyday in monochrome yet somewhere we scream and crave for green(evergreen reference). The fight for survival the urge to know things that weren't meant to be known for us to accept the uncomfortable nd continue living with it to all those paths that led us to different places and all the people we met in the way where some mean good some mean nothing and rest mean bad everyone( CF jisoo ref) of those taught us a lesson. It's that this fics of yours saved me from accidental or potential heartbreaks I would know how to act in a strange situation it's a great insight to take onto those chapters of your life and pour onto your fictional friends. I took some really good lessons from your works and it's not about the fiction it's about how their story might be a real story of someone. Thank you for having a positive outlook on life and seeing how you recovered from so many heartbreaks I wish the best for you to happen. It was all about it I could deliver keep going and nice to meet you💗

      Js is betrothed to whoever inherits the throne and jh isn't quite interested in the thorne himself and wants his cousin sc to be the future king from CF 10th chapter now sc was abdicated but can he come back for the throne later? Or he's been permanently removed? Because if now sc is back and jh wants his cousin to take his position that would make js sc betrothed again but would jh give up on js as well as the throne? But jh and js got engaged right? Their wedding might take place soon as well omg the drama you created badge😭

      sorry I'm a little lost but can you like break it down for me a bit about who were in line for the throne? I've read till chapter 10 and still don't get it. I only found out about sc and hansol also being in line for the throne from your cc. I thought only yoon siblings were supposed to inherit the throne. so it was supposed to be sc who was engaged to js but he abdicated so by default now js became jh's betrothed?

      Are minghao and Soonyoung working for the palace? Or just Jisoo's uni friends? Cuz minghao as jisoo's squire would be a perfect picture like my man is so protective of his js hyung also another thing did js grew up in America hence the English name they were searching for someone sent jiwon and jisoo there after Donghyun was killed? And the betrothment of sc why they wanted a male most importantly jisoo to be his engaged one? Did they made a pact or smth...who will be cheol's squire or were there any previously when he stayed in the palace? Lastly you said he was attempted to be assassinated who would do that? Was it again wonwoo's father? Wow there's so much to unpack but above all I am so excited how these knots would untangle one by one kudos to your writing and way of expressing you seriously have your way with words, will be waiting eagerly for your next ud.

      Now I'm curious about myungho's character because he keeps close to jisoo. Even jisoo looked over his usual seat in the cafe in the recent update I'm convinced he'll be jisoo's squire because of the gyuhao tag

      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> yes! i think it wasn’t clear, but the youngest prince wonwoo mentioned isn’t mingyu but hansol :) hansol’s third in line to the throne as per the first line of the chapter (his mother is princess yoon jia, the youngest sibling of king jonghoon), and chan is his squire (the lee’s serve the yoon dynasty) who wonwoo only sees when hansol visits his cousins :)

      Ik you don't do spoilers but couldn't help but ask you this before updating and continuing with the palace arc what something you want us readers to focus on like every thing in your fic CF are like a hidden puzzle a maze sometimes I get the answer while most of the time I am just mindlessly reading along😄 blame my comprehension skills but yeah I can't help but re read a lot so something you wanna specially mention to look forward to? Thank you and I'll be waiting eagerly for your next update. Stay safe &gt;.&lt;
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> oh i just want u guys to enjoy the story the way u want to :) i do put a lot of easter eggs and hints for major plot points, and i get a lot of my readers saying they need to turn on their brains when they read my works so they postpone reading updates sometimes hsjshjs but honestly, u don't need to! the story will unfold itself naturally.<br><br>if ure the type of reader who likes solving mysteries then look out for even the smallest details and descriptions (talk to me in the reviews because i discuss theories more thoroughly over there, or you can read my past discussions with other reviewers). but like i said, if u just read to have fun, don't fret, all those mysteries will reveal themselves in later chapters.<br><br>if u have a favourite character, maybe focus on how they react to their external environment and other characters they interact with :)<br><br>all characters have important roles in moving the story forward so that's more than thirteen characters including the oc's. all of them have an arc, and it's too much for a casual reader to take note of, so i really suggest reading it in a way you'd enjoy it :)<br><br>stay safe x

      You're updating CF?!? WOW I AM SO EXCITED FOR THE FORTH COMING CHAPTER AND ANOTHER MYSTERY TO UNTANGLE FOR US READERS🥲 coming from your latest twt in priv and kind of getting a hunch it's not as loveless of a marriage as it sounds nor is it only duty to protect his betrothed and the queen's former squire and adding a little pinch of my deluluness in the last part of chapter 9 where jh and js were talking about finding a way to end the engagement jh somehow in the softest corner of jh's mind he broke down with the thought of his friend (spouse) is alr thinking about a royal divorce 😔 BUTTTT I AM SURE KNOWING YOU THEY HAVE TO GET TO THAT FEELING CROSSING STORMS A NECK ON NECK FIGHT AND NONE OF THEM BREAKING DOWN WITHOUT TEARING THE OTHERS APART. I swear the depth of your works always leaves me in awe like I am homecoming to your fics,,,,,,,, stay safe badge love you😭💕

      Was going through one of the earlier chapters of castle fires and found out you mentioning about a girl whom jh grew up with and apparently they dated a few times even told him to marry her in the future a tight friendship bonding they have got I assume but would we see her as one of the main characters or she's just a mention? Will she pose a challenge to jisoo?

      Hi I am the same anon from before (smut of jihan) I am really sorry to pressure you with writing mature scenes, I am new to the fandom and also quite new to the ship. Just went through your evergreen au in twitter as was recommended by my friend and really enjoyed the fic. To clear my point I want to say that I didn't want to pressured you to write smut I was just happy imagining the scenes and proposed it causally the tension there as you created for jihan was so intense and figured out the focal point of your writing it's not only the angst but also how you prepare and groom the characters with their own set of flaws and strengths. I am really really sorry to ask such question I hope you don't mind with it too much. Thank you for writing in your busy schedules we appreciate this a lot. I'll try to read more fics of yours

      I have to say this now!! Your angsts are desserts served *figuratively* the psychological warfare you put between your characters 😥 but, can't wait to read jihan smut from you....craving that spice real bad and ik you'll absolutely out-do yourself with the dishes😌

      hi! oh my god I’m so happy you’re back. I love your fics so much. can I ask though if it’s not too much, do you have plans on putting glimpse of us (jihan au) in your ao3? I’m kind of struggling with privatter and I’m also afraid that I might lose the fic again if something happens and I want to read it over and over. It’s okay if not though I’m just really glad you’re back 😊

      Now that you mentioned it, I'd also like to add, the use of colors as metaphors was genius. When Jisoo said green and red make an ugly color and in the end he decorated their apartment green and red because of Christmas. I think this means Jisoo sees life in a different way now. There's acceptance especially how he welcomed (or went after) Cheol again.<br><br>Your brain, I want to marry it. Thank you for giving us these masterpieces!

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> aaa u caught that! yes, this was intentional :) jisoo used to see his days as "red and green sand waiting to run out of time". it mirrors hana saying this was part of the human experience, that we can't always have green days but we can always have it again.<br><br>cue to jisoo, in the end, seeing it as something he can manage, not something he should drown in.<br><br>thank you for humouring me with these convos :') i really appreciate it

      Hello, Badge! I finished reading Evergreen. It was an emotional experience, I think. The words you wrote flow delicately if that makes sense- I always love the way you manage to make touching stories. And for this oneshot specifically, the plot is simple but there's a painful beauty in it. That's how I feel about it, at least.<br><br>I don't even ship Cheolsoo but I like the way you write them here. Also what they were talking about... those feel so relatable.<br><br>Anyway, I think I'm rambling too much lmao. Thank you for writing that oneshot, Badge. Always love you and your works!

Your characters are always so well written like I can feel cheolsoo's growth after the time skip but can still tell they're the same people. You write the most beautiful scenes in my head.

      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> sure! i remembered enjoying reading these:<br><br>- the hobbit<br><br>(cosy adventures. a classic! i have a link to a really great audiobook if you want)<br><br>- the hunger games trilogy <br><br>(im a basic bitch and this calls for a reread. u should read if u haven't yet)<br><br>- wayward children books <br><br>(grim dark series about children adjusting to the real world after going to magical dimensions. <br><br>can be read as standalones)<br><br>-----<br><br>if you're ready to commit to a large series, i highly recommend rick riordan's works<br><br>- he currently has 22 main books and 10+ supplementary books. he makes mythology enjoyable and accessible to a younger audience :)<br><br>- percy jackson and the olympians <br><br>(ik this is middle grade but if u haven't read this &gt;:( )<br><br>- magnus chase trilogy<br><br>(YA. underrated!! my fave series of his after pjo. <br><br>norse myth. queer!mc and gender fluid!love interest. child of frey x child of loki)<br><br>- heroes of olympus <br><br>(YA; pentalogy after pjo. greek and roman myth)<br><br>attached below are his main books :D<br><br>-----<br><br>- six of crows duology<br><br>(six fugitives in a heist. well-written characters, they're all my babies)<br><br>- a knight of the seven kingdoms<br><br>(if you're a fan of asoiaf. kinda YA i guess, much more wholesome than the main series)<br><br>-----<br><br>i realised while writing they're all fantasy again lol ;A;<br><br>sorry i couldnt recommend more, i realised i just stuck with rick riordan when i was younger then shifted to adult fantasy lmaooo.. also these are mostly book series ;A; i could ask my book clubs for standalone recs if u want or if u're looking for specific genres (e.g, slice of life, romance) u can send a cc again :)<br><br>have a great week and happy reading~

      I'm curious if there's reason why you like darker tropes?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> in terms of reading, i think there's a connotation in my brain that the darker the book, the greater the conflict (which shouldn't be the case, i know). and with that, i like picking apart plots and characters and symbolisms and metaphors and allegories, foreshadowings, and whatnot. it's like a brain exercise,, cures my restlessness. contemporary, slice of life most of the time bore me... im sorry ;A;<br><br>in terms of writing, life is so very bright and happy irl. i thirst for conflict lmaooo /j. on a serious note, i've done a lot of self introspection and observations in my day,,, for someone who has large friend groups, i like writing complex human emotions and how it affects their dynamics with the people around them. i like translating what i see irl into my writing. ~life imitates art~<br><br>tldr; i like reading and writing complexities and making things hard for characters yay~!

      Absolutely devoured castle fires, swwa and glimpse of us without leaving any crumbs, the delicacy leaves no room for dissatisfaction, heard you're updating on October so will wait for that one but for now I have two questions-----<br><br>1.What are some best tropes in bl fanfictions to read/write according to you? <br><br>2.Do recommend some m/m novels, stories where you get your inspo from....<br><br>**I am a writer myself but in writer's block so in dire need of getting up my hopes high to get back in form with some of your recommendations! Thank you &gt;&lt;
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> just a little bit of disclaimer; to tell you the truth, i'm not much of a fan of romance stories (the purely romance ones or those which have it as huge plot point). must be my aroace self speaking, but if you've noticed, my longer works focus on friendship dynamics and how the plot drives the relationships forward. i do write romances, though, that's undeniable. though, i try to establish a foundation/history between characters first. that's why when we get to the part where things finally fall *into place* it's much more worth it to read (in my pov, at least. i love making my characters suffer first. sorry swwa jihancheol).<br><br>i also mostly read fantasy stories and if i happen to read books in the lgbtqia+ spectrum, i usually read sapphic or aroace reps.<br><br>anyway!!! that being said, i'll still answer your questions shjshs<br><br>1. as ive said, i don't read much romance driven works ;A; so, i haven't really delved much into bl ones either. but for romance tropes in general, i like friends to lovers, or, enemies to lovers, or childhood friends to lovers,, anything that gives two characters existing dynamic depth to work with. just a personal preference! i'm a writer who focuses on dynamics, after all :) perhaps your strength in tropes differ from mine.<br><br>2. for plots and writing, in general, i get inspiration from the works of George R.R. Martin, J.R.R. Tolkien, and other high fantasy authors. (i haven't read any of Brandon Sanderson works *yet*, but his writing course is uploaded for free in youtube. i listen to it while working. you should check it out!)<br><br>mlm ones i did read:<br><br>- The Song of Achilles (beautiful retelling of the Trojan War - Rated M)<br><br>- Heartstopper (cute fluffy comics. really fast read - Rated T)<br><br>- The House in the Cerulean Sea (cute with some heart wrenching moments - Rated T)<br><br>asked my mlm friends for recos as well. i trust their taste enough to share their recs sksk<br><br>- Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe (my bestfriend said this is one of his fave books)<br><br>- Carry On trilogy by Rainbow Rowell ('and they were roommates' trope but make it about wizards. pretty sure this was inspired by Drarry)<br><br>- Red, White, and Royal Blue (yes that one movie that's blowing up rn. my friend rated this four stars tho)<br><br>- Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda (ive seen the movie, it's really nice. friend said book is great too)<br><br>- Two Boys Kissing (idek what this is about. friend said just read it)<br><br>thank you for reading my works :') hope these recs will help you!! have fun reading and writing &lt;3

      Hi miss badge! How are you? I'm part of your priv circles and saw tweets about your work. I wanted to ask what's your work and how you chose it? Only if it's not too personal. I'm sorta confused because of your carrd 🥲 It's okay if you ignore that part. And lastly if it's okay with you can you give any tips for someone choosing a field of study.<br><br>Thank you!!! ILYSM<br><br>P.S. can't wait for your ao3 updates ❤️

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hello~ i'm good i'm good. hope you're well, too. don't hesitate to reply in circles :) we can talk there as well sksk<br><br>hmm not gonna be too specific but i work for the music industry, engineering side of things. i have an engineering degree so it's expected of me to work in tech. chose the degree cos i liked problem-solving as a kid (and the money that comes with it).<br><br>some thoughts on the tech industry;<br><br>it took me around three years to settle down and be happy with my field. take note that the tech industry is so very large. it's not just knowing how to code and build things. for me, i mostly focus on user psychology, art, and design (helps me with writing too! cos i get to incorporate these thought processes in my characters) but i do write code as well which is /highly/ profitable (if u saw my circles tweets then yk). the tech industry pays really well and u got lots of personal time (i work four hours max per day). it's a hit or miss though,,, i think having the right connections plays a large role. <br><br>some advice;<br><br>if ure still in high school going to uni, build connections in uni! can not emphasise that enough. <br><br>for choosing a field, it would be naive for me to say 'follow your heart' or 'choose the one that would make you happy' because not everyone could afford that. i say choose what's most convenient for you /at the moment/ and something you can tolerate /if it comes down to it/. choosing a degree program that u know would make u miserable is a recipe for a lot of mental health issues which will most likely make you change degrees anyway (ive seen way too many of my friends do this).<br><br>if you're one of the lucky ones who have the privilege of exploring different degree programs, then don't take your time and privilege for granted. explore and find what's best fit for you; take electives, take introduction courses. remember that what you chose during your senior year of high school can be changed. you can even change your career path after uni (that's what a lot of people i know did,, those who got money from the tech industry and shifted careers when they were able to do so.)<br><br>nyway. you don't have to figure it out immediately. you just have to do what's best for your situation atm. ily2 good luck~ and see u in ao3! don't hesitate to reply in cc again :)

      Hello author-nim! I came across castle fires today and have been hooked since, finished all available chapters in one sitting. 😭needless to say, i love the story and your way of story telling. I must be dumb or something, but after reading your notes and some comments here and there, I am stupid to think that somewhere out there is a completed, older version of it? If there isn't, then pls disregard my query. But if there is, where can I read the full story? I'm sorry, I don't mean to pressure but I really am just impatient and would want to know what happens next. 😭😭😭 sincerely, a reader who can't stop once she finds a real good story
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hii welcome to my account! yes, castle fires already has a completed version for another fandom, however, i took it down two years ago.... welp. sorry bout that. this version will be more detailed though :) that's why past readers say they're reading an almost completely different story (because of the number of characters and how this version will dive more into each storyline). thank you so much for loving the story so far :') i apologise if i can't give u version 1. i might update next week though so hopefully u don't wait that long for an update~ see u then!

      thank you :’) may i know what u mean by self reliance and self sabotage? and if it doesn’t bother u, any further thoughts about this topic?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> oh well, self-reliance isn't necessarily bad. but too much of it can be :) most of the time, self-deprecation, i think, stems from unhealed past traumas/experiences with regard to relationships/friendships. people who do this tend to think they're unworthy of love, or like you said, do not believe others are capable of loving who they are. perhaps in some cases, insecurity can be a factor, too. those are just some surface-level things as it's unique from one person to the other.<br><br>re: thoughts on self-reliance and self-sabotage <br><br>individualists (like myself) tend to put up a wall other people can not cross (regardless of the number of friends and acquaintances). i hated asking other people for help, and i tried to do everything on my own. which isn't exactly healthy, as building intimate and deep relationships is part of the human experience. i used to decline help (self-sabotage), because i didn't want to be a burden to anybody else. but we have to understand that these people who reach out to us, do this because they care for us and they love us. i didn't understand it then.<br><br>anyway, my wake-up call was a very long talk with one of my friends and a therapy session lmaoshjsh it's still hard for me to acknowledge and accept all the love people give me. i still think myself unworthy of it. and im still trying to tell myself that i can take a bigger space in this world, a place in someone else's heart. eh, i'll get there xD i hope you will too!<br><br>idk if anything made sense shjsh it's late where im from xD don't hesitate to reply again. i sincerely hope you're okay :)

      Hiiii please delete this ask and don't read anymore if it could trigger you. This is about life as we know it 🥲<br><br>As someone who's read LAWKI, I definitely felt the sincerity in all of the words you wrote. Objectively, modern royalty/castle fires hurts a lot. The amount of angst in that fic is just unbelievable (I know you're rewriting it and quite honestly I'm afraid because it looks more angsty than the original one). Even the bad boy au and your first one made me bawl my eyes out. But LAWKI............. *DEEP SIGH* LAWKI and its simplicity just slices you through the gut. It's raw pain and anguish whenever we got a flashback scene with Gon and Hannah and it ties back to a present one with Jikyu. I think because it's based more on reality and a lot of us went through the same grieving period during the pandemic. I remember a scene where Jihoon was telling their nephew a story about a flower and a butterfly and the butterfly being swept in the rain but leaving eggs behind. When I tell you I bawled during that scene when the caterpillar became a butterfly and looks exactly like a mix of its mom and dad and the flower said "there you are! my friends came back." Because the baby looks like a mix of Hannah and Gon... I cried so hard... To this day I still wonder how can you make me attached over characters mentioned in flashbacks.<br><br>I also remember you wrote a Doyoung prologue which focused on his grief and how he can't face his nephew for a long time because he reminds him of Gon. There's humanity in your characters simple words can't explain but you capture their emotions perfectly.<br><br>It honestly felt like a lost my friends too when I was reading it... You just have a way with words. I understand why you won't repost it again but I just want you to know I'm grateful I got the chance to read it. It's very beautiful and raw. Maybe it's too personal to share again but LAWKI struck me differently than any other au I've read.<br><br>Sorry I gushed about this. I hope I didn't trigger you with this ask and if I did I'm really sorry it wasn't my intention at all. I want you to know you impact a lot of us because I think you underestimate yourself a lot.<br><br>I'm glad you're doing better now! It seems that you're busy too. Take care, Badge! Happy Easter 😊

NAURUJSHJHS the butterfly, daisy, and the sun story ;A; im surprised u remembered the details :( thank u<br><br>oh yes! the doyoung centric prologue is titled 'ripples'. ding ding ding! i projected a lot in doyoung's character more than jikyu tbh. a lot of my thoughts during that time was poured in the doyoung centric oneshot. im happy i was able to write it effectively :)<br><br>thank you. thank you for reading it. thank you for keeping the characters close to you. and thank you for understanding why i can't repost it anymore :) im just so happy i got to share it and help a lot of people during that time when i was also helping myself. <br><br>thank you for reading my works and dropping by here... it means so much when an old reader decides to drop by :) i'm taking care and i hope you are too! i don't celebrate easter but happy easter to you if you celebrate &lt;3

      'Jeonghan tilted his head, the way Haeun does, the way he does.' - bruh now i want babies<br><br>How do I even start to write my thoughts about this whole time travel stuff....? I just- I'm all in, okay?! &gt;:(  I love this too much I'm getting mad lmao how did you even write a story about this whole comforting idea of seeing your life in the future, and I love that it's almost like talking to your future/past self to tell them what they need to know to keep going. I've been entertaining the idea for so long; what would I say to my past self? What would I say to my future self? I love writing letters to my future self just to see how much I've grown and how insignificant my worries were when I was younger. I would love to travel and tell them to not worry because it'll be fine, you'll be *amazing*.<br><br>And that's /exactly/ what you've did with glimpse of us. Him getting to watch glimpse of them in the future, happy, smiling, *strong*- what can be more comforting than that?? Having the idea written down as a story brings so much joy to me u have no idea ;A;<br><br>'“You’ll know,” Jisoo whispered against his lips. “You’ll know.” He smiled, repeating it with certainty.<br><br>Jisoo forgot when birthdays started to feel dreadful. But this.. he’ll remember this....'<br><br>It's so satisfying and fulfilling, the way you call back and wrapped the whole story and answered back to all the questions just *chef kiss*  that confidence in "you'll know" that quote future Jeonghan and future himself, a future that he /will/ have, the moon and the seas, and the letting go. And now his birthday will be painted with the memory of this. It's just- a very significant moment of breakthrough that he'll remember whenever things get hard, and it's comforting. This whole story is just comforting. I'll probably think of this fic when things get hard.<br><br>Thank you for reading this long ass review (and my trauma dumping sksk). Hope you're doing well!

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> lmaoo actually, 'glimpse of us' was an idea after i read my journal from ten years ago~ ^^ somewhere in it, child me wrote, "i hope when you read this again in ten years, you're finally genuinely happy." and i thought "guuuurl u gonna go through a lot of shit but hey we're still here!!" sdfjkhfjksdh<br><br>i can't say i was happy all throughout the past ten years. but i actually had a laugh thinking back, cos everything that happened to me, made me the person i am now. and i wouldn't change anything tbh. i wouldn't learn if i was just happy. life had to shove me to the ground somehow (e.g, dreading birthdays, grieving friends who aren't here anymore etc.) but also experiencing being loved and feeling that love every single day. <br><br>acknowledgement, honouring emotions, and coming to terms with them; just because you're merely floating at the moment doesn't mean the tides won't carry you high and low again :)<br><br>am i genuinely happy? pretty much yeah. do i still spiral every once in a while, of fucking course woohoo!!!!!<br><br>that's what 'glimpse of us' entails for me. there won't always be a light at the end of the tunnel, but light can be sparked at any point in the darkness ^^ thanks for reading and talking to me, muse &lt;3 im glad you like the fic!!

There is something so loving and tender in your portrayal of their relationship especially in their early stages. Your Jisoo in particular breaks my heart especially in Glimpse of Us.

      I absolutely lurvee that moon and sea metaphor! 'Of knowing the moon more than what’s beneath the seas.' I didn't understand these the first read but when I came back I was like OH Jisoo loves Jeonghan (the moon) and knows him more than himself (the seas) because he stays afloat and never goes beneath the seas to feel his feelings?? and when he feels a pull towards Jeonghan, he push (pull?) himself back, so the lady tells him to let go of control. is that it??<br><br>*casually skipping that scenes because I have nothing to say skksksks*<br><br>Their babies are so smart asdjlsajkss cuties<br><br>'“It’s like you’re seeing him for the first time,” <br><br>“How so?”<br><br>“It’s the same way he looks at you every time.”<br><br>“Even before?” <br><br>“Way before,” “you were too blinded by your own self-deprecation to see.”<br><br>“And now?” “how do you think I see myself?”<br><br>“Like how he sees you.”'<br><br>I cry this is so beautiful I'm all for self love but this- a love that makes you love yourself more - i luv u for writing this scene ;A;<br><br>I have a brother (casually starting another long monologue), and yesterday was his first marriage anniversary. It still shock me nowadays, knowing that my brother who never remember my age, celebrating an anniversary. Our family never celebrates things. But my sister-in-law's family celebrates everything. She was raised in an openly affectionate and loving family (as far as I know). Seeing my brother being openly affectionate to his wife, it's just strange lmao.<br><br>My point is, I think love has to be learned. And what's the best way to learn other being loved by the right person? Sometimes you just have to experience love in order to love back. People say you have to love yourself before you can love someone else. But how can we love ourselves if we have no idea how? Due to my self learning tendency, I learned to love myself with the ideal type of love- unconditional love- and found myself loving others with the same idea only to find out how toxic it was. Loving, caring, kindness- it takes interactions with people to do things right.

      hello miss! I finally got around my procrastination hehe here are glimpse of us thoughts! its been living in my head rent free<br><br>'Jisoo forgot when birthdays started to feel like a biological time bomb of personal expectations. He didn’t look forward to them; dreaded them, to be honest.' <br><br>First line and I already feel attacked my gosh... I guess this is not a unique experience (at this point no such experience exists I think), but yea birthdays used to be so hard to me and this is exactly what goes through my mind each time. On birthday it's just hardd to feel loved, harder than normal days, and it's harder because my family isn't really into date-celebration things. there's nothing special about birthday, they'd say, and as much as I hope that's true and not hope for anything, I just couldn't. maybe because of social media and because I have friends that celebrate theirs festively, and every year I watched my best friends receive so many gifts at school she literally couldn't fit them in her bag (hot people things), she even received whole cake(s) from idk who. after all that, I guess it's inevitable that I hated not getting even one cake or one gift from my own family.  <br><br>This Jisoo dreads his birthday because he feels useless. I hated mine because I love myself, but no one seemed to love me. Made me question whether my self love was misplaced, because why else made me deserve the neglect?<br><br>Yet every year, I forced myself to feel okay. I convinced myself that birthday doesn't mean anything (even though others' birthday means so much to me). Despite all those handcrafted gifts and heartfelt letters I send to every of my precious friends, I only find myself reading a letter from myself to myself and buying cake myself (unconditional self love be peeking through). But you know, I really wasn't fine. Be it words of affirmation, act of service or gifts (quality time and physical touch  already disqualified at this point) , I feel unloved in every language possible on my birthday.<br><br>It was 2 years ago that I finally accepted that I hated my birthday. I validated my own dread, I cried and worried of it and wished it will never come. I was in a particularly bad place at that time. Long story short (it's too long already) it wasn't that bad. It's just- I realized that I love people that I love so deeply and with my whole heart that I couldn't see any love that's less than that. I couldn't /feel/ love that's less than that. It's unfair, for both them and me, because their best efforts were never on par with my best efforts. And I was never comfortable with the idea of *asking* because begging for love is just pathetic. But u know what? I've grown and I've realized that's life is simpler than what I made up in my head lmao and I realized I should've just told them. That what I want for my birthdays is just a cute long essays of why they love me XD<br><br>Naurr this is too long for just that one line ;A;

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hello muse~ i finally answered this!!! oml i hope you're doing well and hopefully u got some rest after your finals :)<br><br>re:birthdays<br><br>well fuck. where do i even begin with this one. i feel like every time you talk to me about personal things, i always see a younger version of myself. just xntj things :')<br><br>i understand the feeling of giving more love than what's received and it sucks. even though we tell ourselves to love unconditionally, there are still moments when we second guess if the love we give is taken for granted. i'm really sorry you had to go through that, muse. i assure you, that wanting to have the love you give reciprocated is completely normal.<br><br>i'm not familiar with your friends, but a similar realisation happened to me years ago, too. for someone whose love language is words, i didn't understand how my childhood friends couldn't /understand/ me. my brain needs to be constantly stimulated; i like critical discussions, debates, literature, etc. and they couldn't provide me that. the older i got, the more i realised how love languages play a part in all of this. like you said, just the right amount of communication and meeting halfway could resolve this but it's easier said than done shjsh it's a lot of trial and error in our part. a lot of misunderstandings, still. but that's how relationships work :) if you want to keep them, you put in the work. i also realised i have other friend groups more fit for brain stimulating activities i wanted. it doesn't mean i love my childhood friends any less, it just means i love them a different way.<br><br>i always say this too; how people think romantic relationships are hard to sustain. in reality, that's how it goes for all relationships, especially friendships.<br><br>food for thought, something a close friend told me recently:<br><br>we 'like' because, and we 'love' despite.<br><br>i hope u enjoy your birthday this year, muse &lt;3 enjoy it however way you want to :)

      WAIT.<br><br>Not anon but you have a child? 😮 that explains why you're always busy... curious as what Life as we know it is too....

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> uhm not biologically ;A; some readers from my past acc already know this since they've been with me during this time;<br><br>my bestfriend passed away when her child was just a toddler, and i was designated as a primary godparent (along with two of my godchild's uncles). though my godchild doesn't stay with me, i do my best to be present in her life as a mother figure (tbh my role is the cool godparent but let's pretend i'm more maternal). so yea, im busy with other things too but spending time with my godchild is a priority during my free time :)<br><br>i wrote a fic inspired by this (life as we know it, named after the movie with a loosely similar premise). the fic focused on each characters' healing process, picking oneself up after a loved one's death, and responsibilities as a pseudo-parent/co-parent. while writing, i realised i haven't come to terms with grief and used writing as a deflection mechanism, which then spiralled into a very long hiatus, inevitably, making it the last work in that writing acc.<br><br>im doing better now though~ i might write a new fic about my thoughts on grief and grieving again (it took a lot of introspection and therapy lol). however, i don't think i'll rewrite lawki despite it being a well-loved fic :)

      genuine question, what's your motivation to write?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> i like talking about plots and characters. engaging me in discussions about fic theories, thoughts about character development and how they navigate or drive the plot themselves. these motivate me a lot to update since i want to see the reactions when reviewers guess plot points correctly ^^ it's always fun reading them. of course, any reaction is fun to read :) even ones that say 'my brain's too fried for this but i like the part where ___'<br><br>clout is nice since a reach gives you more audience to talk to. however, i'm already content if i get to talk to a few regular readers/reviewers or some popping up to comment from time to time. so gaining more audience is a plus, not a goal.<br><br>i also write to improve sentence structures, syntax, and writing style. i think of writing fics as a practice so seeing my writing progress is also a huge motivator :)

      Different anon, but Percy Jackson is so good! I’ve still not read the last book, but the rest of the series that I did read was amazing. <br><br>Anyway I am curious about something.

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> lmaoshjs no need to apologise ^^ yes, yes, march aaa~ february flew by so fast.<br><br>re: greek gods, i don't think it will since it's a collection of classic myth retelling through percy's pov. can't remember much since i read it years ago, there might be inside jokes and references regarding the main series but i still think you can read it as a standalone :D also, it's a nice way to get familiar with percy's tone and voice (the main character of rick riordan's main series). so yeah! i don't think it'll mess up your reading experience :) if you just want to know the mythologies and stories, that's a great start! rick also has another book, "Greek Heroes" if ure interested in other mythology figures :D (icarus, the myth about the boy who flew too close to the sun [discussed in swwa ch 8] is in here~)<br><br>if you plan on eventually reading the main series, you still get to know the gods and goddesses the same time as him cos he's clueless about everything xD but since ure reading greek gods, you now know more than him in the beginning of the series and u get to laugh at him /lh ^^ he's our silly goofy bestie. have fun reading &lt;3

      Hi Badge!! Just curious as to how you actually like write your oneshots. Is it like all in one sitting, or spread out over time? If it one random thought that it not super fleshed out but you just roll with it, or do you have a at least halfy planned out way of how it’s going to go? I never know how I should do it so I figured I’d ask someone I’d trust and whose writing style is amazing!!

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> my one-shot processes are different each time but see which of the following will work for you!<br><br>*) before i start writing my one-shots, i have a word document with all the one-shots i want to write. the summaries are already in there as well as important plot points until the endings. though not everything is definite, it helps with the flow once i start writing a particular fic.<br><br>1) spread out <br><br>i'm still in the experimentation phase of this but i'm trying to have a daily/every other day writing routine. i dedicate maybe 3-4 hours just writing with breaks (check hourly pomodoro technique). this includes everything from writing an outline, filling out paragraphs, editing, etc. and it's spread out over the week. obviously, i'm still grasping at this since i'm not able to churn out updates every week, but this one will work best long term for my busy schedule ++ this will prevent u from having a burnout.<br><br>2) one sitting<br><br>i do write in one sitting. when i'm freer from irl, i dedicate a day to just writing and most of the time when i do this, i end up with an ~8k word document. most times, i'm satisfied with this and just post what i have. but the cons of this is you'd get tired/burned out by the end of the day and would find it hard to bounce back again cos you'll associate exhaustion with writing, unless you're already used to writing in general. (pls take note i used to have a gruelling writing routine during quarantine so i'm comfortable with this practice, but i could see how this would be hard for others)<br><br>*) my actual process rn<br><br>alas, as much as i want to hold onto some routines, i just can't at the moment. i try to do 1) but since i'm busy, i mostly end up with 2) lmfaoooo. though i'm tryin to change that.<br><br>cc has a character limit--i'll reply with part 2 -&gt; https://curiouscat.live/hongrang8/post/1307321522

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> re: plot structures<br><br>*) the architect and the gardener<br><br>writers tend to fall into two different types; those who do best with outline writing (architects), and those who write better while going with the flow (gardeners). architects plan out writings until their epilogues and have a writing style where they drop hints, premonitions, and foreshadowing, making it a different type of read for the readers during their rereads. meanwhile, gardeners explore their stories as they write them.<br><br>*) my plot while writing<br><br>for one shots, though i have summaries and outlines, i'm flexible in changing them as i write the fics if i think some situations, dialogues, characterizations, or paragraphs suit the theme better. i don't /try/ my best to stick to my original plans, i do what i think best fits what i'm writing. (pls take note that i'm a writer who mainly focuses on characterizations and plots, [but] one-shots give more of a leeway with this. think of it as a rest for my brain vs my heavily structured chaptered fics XD). with one-shots, i tend to lean towards the gardener.<br><br>for my chaptered fics,,, well,,, i'm known as the foreshadower so i'm heavily in the architect archetype when it comes to them.<br><br>tldr; you can be both a gardener and an architect. it depends on what type of fic you're trying to do and what suits your writing routine better :) just remember that writing fics is supposed to be an enjoyment, not a chore &lt;3 trial and error is the best way to find what works best for you :) good luck and happy writing~ don't hesitate to drop by again if u have further questions

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> yes! :D this is also implied during the first meeting. the eldest is four years older than jeonghan (visually represented by rv irene who also has a four yr age gap with 95z irl). she already knew "aunt jiwon" and "uncle donghyun" when she was a kid. thank you so much for reading &lt;3 glad you liked it

      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> omgg thank you :') it's a canon-divergent fic focusing on the magic system :D the main character's canonical death still happens but is resurrected by a god. mc becomes the god's champion and a ripple effect across the continent happens since other gods emerge from dormancy. mc becomes trapped in the god's debt ("only death can pay for life") despite not wanting to be resurrected in the first place ++ their whole family and the person who killed them believe they're dead; so they take on an entirely different identity and train in the shadows to become a fighter instead of a politician. the drowned god's words "what is dead may never die; but rises again harder and stronger" is the theme of the fic :)<br><br>the moral dilemma in the fic is where the mc's loyalties lie, since they're not a key player in the political civil war anymore; they're an entirely different being. what cause do they fight for? what will they do with the godly gifts given to them? will they go after the character who once killed them?<br><br>basically a "demigods" fic in the universe with multiple key players ^^<br><br>dk if that made sense. feel free to ask questions!

      Tbh I feel sorry for everyone who won't be able to read the entire plot of your fics. The stories you build are intricately written, the characters,  sceneries, and hidden meanings are so complex but still explained easily. Imo that's very hard to do. I know it's too early to say but SWWA and CF are already masterpieces. I don't know how to say this but your characters feel alive and real. I always look forward whenever you post (Glimpse of us was also an amazing oneshot).<br><br>You're a blessing, Badge! Thank you for sharing your talent with us ♡
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> what the hell u can't make me cry like that /j thank you :( thank you so much. it means a lot to see that the planning stage of my fics is noticed and appreciated :') i already feel the appreciation in the reviews whenever readers open things for discussion about the characters and allegories, but it hits differently being told about it. so thank you,, it means so much. plshjsh swwa and cf are still in the earlier part of their respective stories &gt;&lt; sorry bout that,, but thank you again for the kind words :') as well as for reading glimpse of us!<br><br>and thank you for dropping by :) &lt;3 have a great year ahead, anon.

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> most of my older readers know this, but i wasn't in an okay mental space when i started writing for trsr (why i started and stopped). it's a whole iceberg i don't wanna discuss anymore since it's been two years but i've healed already dw! another reason is that i did try to go back to writing for trsr but it felt really different for me since most of my close moots/oomfs aren't in stantwt anymore. it just felt empty without them ig.<br><br>other reasons as well being, i mostly write narratives, focus on world-building, fantasy plotlines, etc. which i don't think a lot of teume readers are interested in (i always ended up discontinuing my works because nobody talks to me about them.... ;A; my main motivation to write is to have someone to talk to). i feel like soc med au's are more palatable and i did fall into this trap before but they're just not my thing.<br><br>i still support the boys, i do drop by to see what theyve been up to. literally has got nothing to do with them, but writing for them isn't something i'd see myself go back to anytime soon.<br><br>tldr;  mental space i associated it with, my oomfies r gone, i have a lot of fantasy narratives planned [and] want to talk abt with readers

      Hi j! Imysm (˃̣̣̥︿˂̣̣̥) saw that you're back and can't help but feel sad that teuland lost one of its most talented writers. I read your new works and feel nostalgic over modern royalty and your hogwarts au that got discontinued (I can't remember the title sorry ˃̣̣̥︿˂̣̣̥) It's great to see that a lot of new readers are giving your aus the attention they deserve!

All your works are beautiful thank you for sharing them with us ❤️ Take care!

      I think the shipping/writing acc is a bottom shva enthusiast and was the one that did the controversial thing? <br><br>So they're asking if badge supports them? maybe?<br><br>I think they meant well but badge isn't involved in stantwt or reads that many other fics so it's kinda useless

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> so ive been told &gt;.&lt; ive actually been a casual listener since '17 so im familiar with the members even way back (one of the few kpop groups whose discography i could play on shuffle + some close friends are carats). i had rock with you on repeat for an unhealthy amount of time during that cb tho and ig youtube picked up on it so it recced me gose, specifically the ego episode.<br><br>didn't think much before clicking because i do watch random kpop variety shows even with groups i don't stan. the thing about me is that, i'm a sucker for good plot and lore and theories and brEH that episode got me fucking hooked because it's self-contained within two episodes but enough of a time to let the viewers see how each members' personalities shine. not to mention the quality of the production. i spiraled from there and watched bad clue, one million won, don't lie, etc.<br><br>so yeah i was initially sucked in as a cubic and during that time i was in a very long writing hiatus. my impulsive ass went 'hey! u like mingyu and wonwoo in that ego episode! u like the oldest hyungs' dynamics! why don't u give the hogwarts plot to them' and thus swwa was born a week later

Anyway, I respect your anonymity here and I hope all your readers old and new do to. Hope you see BP live!

      The fandom is in one of your answers here and I tried to find it through keywords 😅 I'm a huge fan of the show but haven't read the books. Reading bbbh was nostalgic it's still familiar and a little different at the same time. Discovering tsott after it was a treat! I also read your svt fics and saw you're going to update them! I gotta be honest, I haven't read modern royalty in your previous account so Im reading it for the first time. I feel for both Jeonghan and Jisoo and can't wait how Jeonghan will react next chapter!!<br><br>Thank you for sharing your wonderful worlds with us and the time you take to carefully crafting them. It really shows in your writing ❤️ Fighting!!

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> LMAOOO ok yea i checked. i did answer that.... ahahahjshjahs. that's fine! i'll try my best to make the fic readable even for non-book readers. magic system isn't entirely discussed yet even in DwD (i'm guessing GRRM will discuss it in WoW or aDoS) so i'll bullshit my way through it. i posted bbbh as a lil jokey jokey and tsott on a whim so now i have them under my belt cos lots of people are reading them ;A; but im really glad you're enjoying both fics &lt;3<br><br>not reading modern royalty yet is actually better because u don't know the plot &gt;:D u get to enjoy it with the others mwahahaha jeonghan needs to calm down,,, there's a hoard of angry readers if he hurts jisoo &gt;&lt;<br><br>thank you so much for reading my works :') it really means a lot knowing u scoured through another fandom just to read my past ones lol. have a great week!

      Hi hi! Im one of your readers since jihoonhour and managed to find bbbh because i wanted to read it again but it also led me to tsott. Fortunately Im also part of the same fandom so it was a delight to read another one of your writing.<br><br>I had to go here because i wanted to SOB in your cc! the prologue in tsott is unmatched, phenomenal, the imagery and visuals are AMAZING. I remember you said your main strength in writing is world building and fantasy and im so happy i get to read it because I know that fic is going to be INCREDIBLE. I haven't read a concept like that in the fandom because most mainly focus on the political aspect and war so seeing a fic about the magic system made me so excited and it's written by you!<br><br>Im completely in love with this paragraph in particular "How he's made of the sea now; how it puts out the flames that burn from inside him, and all the others that share the blood of fire. You’ll never know the kiss of the gods, or how close you are to them until you’ve experienced death and resurrection. For it is not in the sky do you come close to the deities, but in the trenches of the sea." It sets the tone for the entire plot and I am so seated!!! <br><br>This one as well "Champion of the drowned, tell me what it's like to rise." Goosebumps goosebumps!!!!<br><br>I know there's a possibility it won't be written but I hope you do consider continuing it. I love your writing so much you don't even know. Patiently waiting for your updates and hoping you're well, Badge! Love you

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> first of all, how the fuck did u find it??? djfdjh!?? /lighthearted. second, thank you so much for the kind words wtf im sobbing ;A;<br><br>but pls ive been laughing/crying at this cc for minutes because im still trying to figure out how u guys are finding my fics in another fandom?? hajshjhah helppp pls do tell me if u see this. but also, it's funny how u reached tsott. honestly, the prologue was something i wrote on a whim at 2am when i was trying to update bhhh and have long since drafted other things aside from it. i didn't really expect the amount of traction it got for a prologue and im actually scared of writing it now as the prose now has a baseline.<br><br>might get back on that fic but it will take a while because im trying to focus on my svt ones ++ tsott is going to be a monster (figuratively.. and literally dealing with,, monsters and gods..) and need a ton of research regarding each character's future role but thank you so much for taking the time to drop by here :) we all love the resurrection of our favourite drowned lad &lt;3<br><br>thank you for sticking with me &lt;3 ily too and have a great year ahead! :)

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> wrote a whole essay and cc apparently has character limit lol ;A; anyway-<br><br>- critical thinking & deep intimate relationships: intellectual conversations and exchange of opinion through healthy debates helped a lot in my understanding of the people around me. my friends and i often discuss philosophy and morally ambiguous questions. which will then reflect our morals, challenge each other's beliefs, act as the other's devil's advocate etc. the reason why most if not all of my characters seem like well-realized people, because they are in fact, patterned after the thought processes of real people. i often ask myself, "if [my friend] was in this conversation what would they say? what would they do? what are the nuances in their actions, in the way they speak, their internal monologue, their purpose?"<br><br>broadening your perspective, seeing the world in another person's shoes, and eliminating your biases make way for an array of different-sounding characters on your plate.<br><br>[choosing when to write complex characters]<br><br>- personally, i like reading morally grey stories because it gives a glimpse of human mistakes and tragedy. HOWEVER, i don't think this level of depth is applicable to all stories, especially light-hearted fanfiction.<br><br>- usually, complexity is seen in longer works as writers often dive deep into the character's nuances and monologue. so ask yourself first, are you writing a shorter fic or a long multi-chaptered one? does the character's complexity drive the story forward, or is it a filler? <br><br>- personally, tropes are a really great way to start your character ++ u can play with the traits like a sandbox. some characters don't have to be this well-realized complex character,,, and that's fine. characters and plot go hand in hand. if the plot tone doesn't call for this level of intricacy, you /can/ still write enjoyable characters without all this research.<br><br>at the end of the day, what matters is your own enjoyment and fulfilment in writing. hope this helped and if u have any more questions feel free to drop by :) happy writing!

      Hi jihour! I hope you're doing well &lt;33 I just wanted to let you know I'm thinking of creating my own writing account after thinking about it for a very long time (I told you this before in curiouscat but I got busy and started to pick up writing again recently). Do you have any tips in writing a character? I've always loved the way you write yours and how you make them flawed and well characterized. Thank you for being an inspiration to a lot of us! always rooting for you, miss &lt;3
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> this answer is long overdue, i'm really sorry about that ;A; i hope you still see this. anyway. shsh okay writing characters in depth.<br><br>pls note i am far from being a professional writer and have taken zero writing classes. i'm going to list down things that worked /for me/. perhaps u can pick up some ideas that would suit your writing below. take what's applicable /for you/ and leave those that aren't :)<br><br>[on your own]<br><br>- sense of self/introspection: one of the most basic foundations of writing a complex character is being able to understand what makes a character well realized. luckily for everyone, there's a readily available complex human to pick apart; yourself!! and even if you don't want to pattern a character after you/your experiences, you can always pattern your thought processes as you self-introspect.<br><br>what are their basic traits? (what are you known for?) how do other characters perceive them? (how do your close friends see you?) what's their inner monologue? (what are you thinking during certain life events?) does it align with their actions? (do you act upon them or do you keep them to yourself?) what are their motivations in the story? (what makes you do things purposefully?)<br><br>- reading: read, read, and read. reading gives you perspective on how different authors write their characters. take note of character points that caught your attention and reflect on what you would want to improve should you be the one writing the characters. picking apart characters to see the layers upon layers beneath their actions is a good exercise too. writing a character study after reading a novel/work you really like also helps in empathizing and understanding how a complex character is made.<br><br>[other influences]<br><br>- talking to people: make it a point to learn from the person you're talking to, whether it's an acquaintance or a close friend. keep in mind, that everyone around you knows something you don't. these conversations often lead you to reflect on your own biases and are a great way to empathize with people from different walks of life. and empathizing as we know, is a step toward making a character feel more authentic in their writing.

      Favorite character you wrote and why?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> i'm gonna answer this in general (even works outside of kpop). a protective older brother figure from an old fic (actually based on one of my irls). it's just so fun seeing everybody (the readers) get annoyed by/angry at him cos he's borderline an extremist when it comes to his younger sibling, and seeing the audience understand his character better as the story progressed (why he's being protective, why he doesn't want his frat members to come close to his sibling),, in the end, he became the favourite character, even more than the main characters. it's funny.

      Hi badge! Don't stress too much in writing castle fires and swwa updates 🤗 We'll wait patiently
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> dw &lt;3 it's okay, i'm chill ^^ castle fires updates for me are easier to write because i already have the first version of the fic completed. swwa on the other hand takes longer because i'm writing it from scratch, but writing updates for both is doable. it's just that i'm busy irl that's why i'm slow at churning out updates. thank you for the concern &lt;3 have a great weekend!

      hi. i've been your avid reader and aside from the wonderful stories you share with us, i value your takes on issues within writing community and pieces of advice for struggling writers too. i've been thinking of stopping writing fics because (1) busy months ahead and (2) ig i don't have any reason to do so any more. i started writing because the genre i had been craving for was not available (not too many options) back then. now that the community is thriving, and there are more talented writers, i can easily get hold of whatever suits my mood atm. anyway, maybe i'll find another reason to write (maybe even just to make my brain function outside work). i just want to thank you for reminding everyone to always find a reason why we do things. ily, jhour. im always rooting for you!💕

      hi miss! it’s muse :3 idk if you noticed but i’m reading through your update slowly rn<br><br>the truth is, i’ve been quite distracted with a lot of thoughts and overthinking stuffs in my life so i couldn’t read much these days ;A; i love reading your cc, and i found great perspectives in here, so i want to rant a bit hehe<br><br>recently,  i received the perfect marks for my pre-university courses(i was the only one in my school), went up stages for awards etc, lots of people been congratulating me left and right. but instead of feeling happy, there’s this looming fear since i got my result. the thing that bothers me the most is; what now? as much as i want to take it step by step and slowly figure out, i have to choose what to further in university asap. people been telling me how lucky i am because i will probably be accepted wherever i apply to, but idk, i just have no idea what to do with my life<br><br>nowadays i hate the word ‘passion’, because people push it on my face too much lmao<br><br>it’s quite ironic - to feel like a failure when all i obtained was success. idk, i’m just too uninterested in science and technology (and people are mad at me bcs of that) and the things i am interested in, is apparently ‘a waste of my potential ‘<br><br>do you think there is such thing as ‘wasted potential’? <br><br>and yknow, i am also afraid that my ‘interest’ is just a fleeting curiosity because of my youth and my lack of research and thinking things through (even tho i think i am currently overthinking), i hate to think that one day i might quit and they’ll say ‘i told you so’ <br><br>i am terribly anxious for the future rn, and if i could ask for the best ending, it will be one where i have my peace of mind :)) wealth, status, popularity - i just want to be content with who i am :’)<br><br>oh and the weird thing is, i’m not sure if ‘people’ and ‘they’ i mentioned above are real, or just me being too hard on myself. seriously, it’s been confusing me for quite a while now.<br><br>feels great to rant here :D would love it if you can offer some advices/comments/whatever perspective you can offer because honestly, i am backed against the wall lately haha<br><br>that’s it :3 thank you for reading luv u &lt;3

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hewo~ take your time, muse!! glad my cc's is a safe haven for you :)<br><br>well first of all, damn, congratulations!! you deserve to feel happy for your achievements :D if there's one thing i learned during times like those, it's to remind myself that i'm allowed to be happy for the hard work i've done. it's only me that's refraining myself from being mindful of positive emotions. let it flow to you and embrace your success. rewarding yourself shouldn't feel like a punishment :)<br><br>lmaoo a lot of what you said felt like it was ghost written by younger me pre-university.<br><br>unlike you, however, i didn't know what my passion was as a teenager. i've always said i love science and maths as much as i love arts and literature, which gave me options. and the option i took was to be a competitive motherfucker and take an engineering degree to prove to everyone that girls can survive a male dominated field. also it paid fucking well. aaaaaaaand it made me miserable :D what i want you to learn from this, is to think thoroughly /why/ you want to pursue each option you have. it goes back to my principle of being purposeful with all your actions. weigh all the pros and cons. at this point in time, it's okay to feel confused and it's okay to make mistakes. just learn not to blame yourself and stand back up should hurdles come your way.<br><br>i feel like you already know what you want though, based on your cc. so the next step for this, is to ask yourself, 'is this feasible?' a lot of people are restrained by their circumstances, most often than not financially. if you feel that you're privileged enough to pursue what you want, then, i say go for it.<br><br>i don't think there's such a thing as wasted potential, as long as you hone it. just because you will pursue a certain track in university doesn't mean you can't pursue other activities in the future. life isn't meant to be that way as humans are multifaceted. there are many avenues for you to learn, such as community events, online courses with certifications, and joining organizations. learning doesn't stop at university and you can always be a student for life.<br><br>one thing to note about your cc is you need to remind yourself that you don't owe anyone your choices. and whatever they say about it is negligible (e.g, 'i told u so'). living for somebody else's dream or opinion will most likely make you miserable, and have a strained relationship with them as these are formative years of your life. receive and learn from constructive criticism, and throw away unwanted ones.<br><br>at the end of the day, i'm just a stranger in the internet and i know deep down, you already know what's best for you :) peace of mind, as you said.<br><br>you're young, you're not running against the clock and you never will be. don't be afraid to make choices and make mistakes. with mistakes, you'll learn, and by learning you'll grow.<br><br>cheers, muse :) ily2 &lt;3

      Hi! Do you always stick to your original character sketches or they just change as you write your chapters? I feel like mine almost always end up completely different from where I started.😕
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> edit: ok so i just looked up what character sketches mean im sorry ;A;<br><br>the short answer is, yes, they change as i write the chapters. <br><br>the long answer is, yes i change them because they're intended to. for someone like me who's very heavy on characterization and plot, i make it a point to portray their growth throughout the chapters. if you've read my works, most if not all of my main characters have a trait they need to improve on/learn from.<br><br>i think asking yourself the purpose of the characters during the first draft would help :) if it's a feel good genre or a short fic, i think it's better to stick with the original sketch. but if u intend on writing a longer story, just be wary that the changes should be gradual and purposeful. the readers need to understand where the shift in characterization came from. and it should serve and tie your intended plot. in the readers' pov, they still need to understand that it's the same character, just evolving with the story.<br><br>hope that helped~ don't hesitate to ask me more here if my answer didn't make sense ahsha

      how do you stay motivated to write? i really want to but like the other anon ive been putting it off
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> welp *cracks knuckles* looks like a lot of us aren't motivated these days<br><br>i don't know if you've been with me from before, but way back then, i used to write everyday left and write; just work, write, sleep. because i love writing and i love the community, but eventually that lifestyle burnt me out. of course, there were a lot of other factors for my hiatus, but ig that's a big contributor. don't just write for the sake of updating. it will show in your writing and it will tire you out. we all have our "update schedule" goals but be kind to yourself when you don't meet them :)<br><br>second, i'm always outside of stantwt. i hyperfixate on a lot of things (games, books, songs, intellectual conversations), and i find writing inspo through them, though that isn't my intention. happy accidents, if you may. i have this one word document just full of random dialogues, quotes, metaphors,  etc. and going through them when i have the time always does the trick to make me write down some narratives. just pushing through that initial resistance would lead me to write non-stop. don't focus on perfection the first time you write the draft, just the structure is enough. afterwards, you can improve on it.<br><br>and lastly, i'll sound like a broken record; but find the reason why you write. personally, i found mine to be evolving as time passed by. the essence of writing for me has always been to reach out to people with my works. and i believe i've already achieved that with the community that stuck with me even though i disappeared for two years sksk. i honestly just want someone to discuss my plots and characters with,, and i'm lucky to have those people, really. just being content with the same five reviewers geeking out with me every time i post a new chapter. so now that i've achieved the "reaching out" part, i'm currently just focusing on improving my syntax, sentence structures, and plot analysis. that's why i don't think i'll go back to soc med fics. it's just not for me, and if i spend time going over those for traction, my reason for narrative improvement will be lost. i'm just chilling tbvh i haven't written in a while. but at least i know that at the end of the day, regardless if i update after weeks, that the same people would still talk to me about my fic and that's enough motivation for me.<br><br>tldr; just chill,  take a break outside of writing, and find your reason<br><br>good luck, anon~ hope you get motivated to write soon :)

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> yeah, of course :) that's what's nice about fanfiction, right? you get to write about something you like at your own terms.<br><br>my advice though, is to know your reason as to why you wanna write. "why am i writing in the first place? to who am i writing this for?" and everything else would be easier after that. (e.g, writing for your own enjoyment, practicing writing, getting in touch with the writing community, passing time because you're bored, etc.)<br><br>just write, just practice. do your thing and be authentic to your reason so you could go back to it in moments of doubt. the audience who would resonate with your works will eventually find you, don't worry about others who won't! writing fanfiction shouldn't be an obligation.<br><br>rooting for you, anon~ take your time and take care :)

      How about Yoshiho Ate? It's a one-shot that can contain 3.5K words and up. It all started in high school. Yoshi really hates people who've taken what's his. Mashiho is a highly honorable but selfish student who thinks only about himself. Him and Mash were always fighting every time they met. To stop their annoyance, their classmates started shipping them, including Jihoon. Little did he know that Mashiho liked him(referring to Jihoon). Mashiho tried to stop him from shipping him with Yoshi because he liked him, but Jihoon didn't take Mashiho's word seriously. The shipping continues in a month. Both boys try not to fall for that goddam shipping, but later on they realize that they both like each other. They slowly interact with each other until Christmas comes. Yoshi decides to confess his love to him. Mashiho loves him too, but he's still not ready for a relationship. After graduation, Mashho leaves the Philippines and decides to live in America for good. Mashiho still didn't want to go back to the Philippines even though his happiness was there, until he received a call from his cousin about their grandmother's death. Mashiho was heartbroken and came back to the Philippines. While walking alone on the street trying to take some time off from his grandmother's death, he saw a newly built coffee shop nearby. Mashiho decided to enter the shop. After Mashiho ordered his, he scrolled through his phone. He heard his name called by, so he stood up and grabbed his coffee. When he was about to leave the shop, some stranger bumped into him slightly. It took him a minute to realize it was Yoshi. After an unexpected meeting up, Yoshi invites him to have some talk since it's been a year since they saw each other. Yoshi confessed that he still loved him and how hard he tried to find him in a couple of months, not knowing that he was going to America. Mashiho seems to be pleased to see someone who truly and genuiely loves him, but he didn't accept his love for a second time. He had a reason, but he didn't tell Yoshi. He understood him and will always understand him. Meanwhile, Mashiho runs into his old friend Jihoon in an exhibit, and while he still has feelings for him, he decides to let them go. Mashiho really liked him before. He tried to contact him back then in America, but it was all too late. Mashiho don't have feelings with him anymore. He truly loves Yoshi, but he is just afraid of what people will think about them if they get together. Mashiho already thinks of the consequences that can happen if they both get into a relationship. He loves Yoshi so much, but his love is not that strong to fight for him.

      Hi miss! it’s muse ;) i just read sukhoon constellation and i feel like dropping my rants here hehe<br><br>ooof longing has to be one of my all time fav type of angst ;A; as someone who overthink before making any decision, it’s hard to choose something or someone just because i like them,,, which is kinda weird because what else do you need?? but choosing is just hard, yknow? we’ll be afraid of rejection, what other people think, is it possible? etcetc sksksk so i really love it when they finally able to choose each other after the long process of longing<br><br>it feels good as in the good feeling after solving a difficult math problem<br><br>‘ how can something so beautiful and clear be farther than the stars themselves?’<br><br>‘ Longing now turned into a stanza of a poem he can finally verbalise.’<br><br>‘ They can't go back to normal because normalcy<br><br>didn't entail intimacy.’

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> please same longing and yearning is one of my favorite tropes ever you could just write so much heartbreak in paragraphs and it's just an internal monologue lmfao &gt;&lt; ALSO SAME LOL i take into consideration EVERYTHING before liking someone and i always end up just liking them platonically because it works best that way. personally, i feel like rejection is something a lot of people are afraid of, but it really depends on the current dynamics you have with the person if they'll take it well, be chill about it, or be down right awkward. and thus, the overthinking occurs.<br><br>hehehe love those lines &lt;3 thank you for dropping by, muse!!

      hi j! it's been so long since i wanted to drop by in your cc. it's 2.00 am in my region while i'm writing this, so probably this is the best time to give you my ramble. i'm sorry to postponed dropping by here much longer than i intended to, but here i am. 😆<br><br>i've read your pinned message, and i respect your decision. i will miss life as we know it, the sigil on my skin, and your other great works but yeah life must go on. however i really feel thankful for your treasure fics that have been healing me in some way for couple months. you may notice i follow you in your new acc today err i mean last night (kinda get time disorientation). i follow you there because i really enjoy your writing and i will read whatever you write about to continue getting healed again through that. moreover i've been fan of harry potter & percy jackson series since my teenage years so i'm more than happy to follow deusxluna. oh one more, congrats on getting your dream job! you deserved it! 🎉<br><br>oh! oh! oh! i've been promised you to give my ramble about your yedam centric, repose, so here they are:<br><br>you know what, i reread the drabble again to give my proper review, and i'm crying while rereading it. i could see myself in yedam's reflection. the younger me never allow people to cross the line that i've been setting up from beginning, in order to not get too attached with them. that's why i really relate with jihoon in as we know it too, because i people around me always open up to me while i can't reciprocate the action. i rarely rely on other people because like what yedam thought<br><br>"And maybe, just maybe, a part of him didn’t want people closer than drawn lines—not because they’d disappoint him, but how he’d disappoint them."<br><br>but recently i'm doing much better than before. like when yedam allow doyoung enter the room as the methaphor of allowing him to get closer the drawn line, i also try to rely more to people around me, like my lil sis (yeah dobby is like the personification of her for me)  and also my best friends. because i believe our growth isn't something you can do alone.<br><br>i guess that's all my long ramble. 😆 maybe this is my last ramble in your cc acc, i will give another in your other cc when you finally post something in deusxluna. and by the way i'm planning to start writinv my own treasure fics in my mother language, and one of the reason is because i want to touch readers' feeling and also healing them, like what you've been doing to me. so yeah see you in other acc and have a nice sunday (if your timezone is not quite different drom mine). 🧡🧡🧡<br><br>- A ☀️🦊

      Hello Ms. Jhour~ I totally respect your decision and I just want to thank you for sharing your stories to us. Your works are very healing (it hurts but thats where the fun is) and it really helps me cope with stress and anxiety because of school. I've said this a lot of times but reading your aus and drabbles (esp. centric ones) helps me sort my thoughts and emotions out. Thank you for being my anchor through your stories Ms. Jhour!! I don't know what would've happened to me if J haven't stumbled upon your account. I was also somehow motivated to write again. I'll just think that Haneul somewhere grew well with fictional Jikyu getting back together. I wish you all the best~ I hope you don't deactivate your account but if you have to I totally respect it. Sorry if this is kinda long lmao. Thank you again, I love you and I'll miss you!!! Take care~💖

Haneul is growing up well with his dumb uncles indeed hehe &gt;&lt; i won't deactivate! i still really want to interact hehe. thank you and i love you too &lt;3 always take care

      mumsey...mumsey....i came by here bc i can't say these earlier on my reply on your twt. momsey, i can't express how much i was thankful for your works and how much they helped me going on with my messed up life. i had discovered things that i never thought existed. i realized that, i shouldn't be scared to other people about how i am supposed to act. i should be scared on whatever i think of myself because, that's what matters the most; i actually had interest on writing when i was seven years old. my mom forced me to start reading when i was at the age of three, at the age of five, i can niw read english. and that was the first time i read the books in our home, both educational ones and fictions. and i had the interest to write when i was seven, but my mom told me it's a waste of time, so i lived with that mindset until i was 13, but my thirst for writing called me again, i turned it down, until i met you last year. mumsey, you don't know how much you helped me go through and start writing again. mumsey, i love you. thank you for sharing your works with us, thank you for letting me call you mom; you had always felt like home to me. i love you so much. let's meet each other in your booktwt acc, aye? i love you!

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> blee! :) im sorry i just got back to you now. and i'd like to thank you for even giving my writing a chance.<br><br>i'm really glad you found your way to my account, and reigniting your love for written works. it's always nice to see someone going back to their passion even though i know you always had it in you. you only needed that little push, right? you can always talk to me about these things (although i'm very slow at replying) if you want sound advice. following what you love is never a waste of time. as yedam once said in my writers au, "if it makes you feel alive, it's not."  :) <br><br>love you too :) plshsjhs im so used to being that one mom friend here i dont even blink anymore when u guys call me mom. stay in touch, blee &lt;3

      hi again haha<br><br>I just wanted to mention this one random thing that I’ve been thinking about since a few weeks now. It’s so random and maybe weird hsjsj<br><br>But like basically, it’s just that, for some reason I really like how you’re a lil mysterious. At least to me lmao. Like we don’t know where you’re from (I don’t think that’s imp tho haha), we don’t know your real name ( at least I don’t hsjsj and how we all just refer to you as jhour and literally no name) and idk I just like this type of anonymity? suspense? mystery? hsjsj like idk it just makes everything a little interesting for me.<br><br>this all sounded and was worded way better in my head <br><br>GOODBYE I sound so weird and creepy 🏃🏻‍♀️
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hahaha help <br><br>i'm just really paranoid about internet security and such. but it's nice just staying anonymous in this app,,, makes me feel more free :) don't worry, u don't sound creepy haha,,, others tell me the anonymity is cool too :)

      hi jhour! <br><br>I hope you’ll be doing good over there and would be taking good care of yourself. I really hope this break is giving your mind a bit relaxation that you would’ve been craving for so long. <br><br>Also, a very happy mother’s day to my foster mother hsjsj. This might be weird but your works have really taught me so much. They’ve given me comfort when I was looking for it. They gave me guidance when I needed it. Gave me motivation to become a better person. Inspired me to great heights. Made me proud of the fact that I read treasure aus because it means I can brag about you and your works and how they’re not just fAnFiCs but a learning point for me. Okay too deep, but yeah thank you for existing! I mean it! &lt;33

      hi J! i wanted to ask if you ever felt sad leaving the jihoonhour? how did you cope from it? i think i want to start new twitter account too but its really hard for me to let go because i already have followers and it took me a lot of effort to write my aus. have a nice night/day!! take care
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hello~ <br><br>honestly, no. if you've read my closing note, my comfort comes first before the numbers i receive here, so it was easy for me to let go of this account. sure, i have a lot of works here that are very dear to me, a lot of readers too. but starting fresh is honestly the best decision i've made. <br><br>the readers who read for my writing still have the choice of staying in touch through my other account. i think that's what's most important for me, starting off again with a community built from that.<br><br>i guess my advice is, don't think about the numbers too much. think of the reason why you really want to create another account first, and go from there.<br><br>you can still reach out to me here if you have any questions, or if i closed this i'll create a new cc in deusxluna.<br><br>good luck! :) and take care too

      hi jhour I’m here again hsjsj I’ve been worrying about smtg lately so I just wanted to vent it out. I told you that I’ve been wanting to write as well. Well I made some progress last week and I started writing. However, what if nobody reads my works? This has been on my mind a lot. Like what if nobody even finds it, reads it let alone likes it?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hello~ welcome back!<br><br>how to be discovered:<br><br>i guess if you're starting out, try to reach out to other writers and readers within the community :) my first tweet was actually me just trying to find mutuals who are interested in reading english works for treasure (you could still search for it haha), or you could use the #teufind tag and i'm sure readers/writers would find you. and lastly, don't forget to tag your works accordingly (ship, tags, au, fic, drabble, treasure etc.), i assure you a lot of people search through those, because a lot of my readers find me through it.<br><br>hate/criticism:<br><br>if nobody likes it fuck them. im just kidding. on a serious note, if nobody likes it (which i doubt, since i've only ever encountered nice readers here, they will always outweigh the negativity), then maybe think back as to why,, if it's just general hate, ignore it. if it's constructive criticism, take it into consideration. <br><br>remember the main reason why you started writing in the first place. if you're writing for yourself and you want to improve on this skill, then it's definitely okay to write with a few audience in the beginning (people will find you through the tags, trust me even new au accs i see have like 25 immediate followers). at the end of the day, readers who would resonate with you and your works will stay with you :)<br><br>good luck~ drop by if you wanna ask more questions

      hi jhour! <br><br>A few weeks back, I told you you’ve encouraged me to start writing too (tho I feel like so many people tell you this haha) so I just wanted to update you on that. <br><br>I came up with a prompt after thinking so much. And what I realized was that writing isn’t as easy as it seems. I’ve always been complimented on my English writings (I’m not a native English speaker) in school which encourages me a lot, but when I read works of people like you, I realize I still have a long way to go. And I don’t hate it bcos it makes me wanna improve even more. To reach a certain level of excellence. <br><br>When I started writing after coming up with the prompt/plot, trust me when I tell you, I couldn’t write at all. I don’t know why but I just couldn’t. Everything seemed so difficult even connecting sentences was even harder than school essays hsjs. <br><br>It just made me appreciate you even more. The time and effort you put in your work is really visible and your works are always gorgeous and so well worded. You really have a way with your words that just makes me feel so many emotions. <br><br>I hope I can become as talented as you some day.<br><br>I love you and your works jhour! Have a great day/night and a good rest pls!
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hi anon~<br><br>oh, i get you though. it's really hard to structure sentences especially if you want your readers to feel a certain way. i sometimes look at blank pages of documents for minutes and hours too, and i assure you even authors who are known publicly experience writing slumps that take years, novels getting published one to two years apart.<br><br>writing is hard, there's no going about it. it takes a lot of reading and learning before you can write as effectively as you would like to. and even then, you won't be satisfied because you'd only want to strive to be better, to reach that certain prose structure professional writers possess; believe it or not, i still feel this too. but just know that even wanting to improve on this skill is something you should already be proud of :) you see, i haven't read your works yet, but just having read your cc and knowing people around you praise you for your writing, you're already doing great as you are. just remember not to be too hard on yourself and do things at your own pace :)<br><br>really proud of you~ drop by any time if you wanna talk to me about your thoughts and progress! I love you too and I hope you have a great May ahead!

      Hi, Jhour! <br><br>I've recently just came across your work, and I'm so glad I did. Like you, I've always been passionate about writing, but I stopped a few years back because of other matters (aka responsibilities) at home and in school.<br><br>Then, I was once again reminded why I got interested in writing in the first place when I had my literature classes during the beginning of the year--I was able to express myself. Whenever I have a hard time, I usually just bottle everything up and let time do its thing. Time, after all, makes everything better, but it does not heal. Suppressing emotions doesn't mean that you've successfully mananged  them, it only engulfs you with perpetual loneliness and emptiness.<br><br>Through writing, I was able to confront them. Aside from that, you're also one of the many factors that sparked that flame that has once been extinguished in me. I'm really grateful for that.<br><br>One time I was reading your work while I was at an emotional and very anxious state, I was really tearing up. I don't even know if it was because of the emotions that greatly overwhelmed me that time, or your beautifully crafted words (could be both lol). I've always felt a sense of warmth in your writings, so I want to thank and commend you. <br><br>I hope you that you'll keep doing the things that you love and that make you happy. I'm so proud of you! All the best muwah luv u!
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hi~ welcome to the community :)<br><br>i don't know if you know this, but we had the same reason for putting writing on hold. i didn't write for five years until i tried to find a sense of purpose again during very dark times.<br><br>that's so nice knowing you had an avenue to go over your passion for writing. i never had any writing/literature classes back in uni since i was an engineering major. i hope i took some, but i didn't, in fear that i wasn't as good as i was before and i have to confront that fact with my grades haha. <br><br>i do agree that writing helps us free ourselves from the emotions suffocating us. i've been doing it for years, but not exactly in a form of stories i write just like now. i'm saying this to you in hopes that you could write for yourself too, maybe journal or a personal private blog to vent your emotions. these alternative platforms helped me before i decided to write my healing in story format. although i personally believe you already are doing that :) <br><br>i'm very happy to know that my stories helped ignite your interest in the art of writing again. please know that i'm very proud of you for giving your passion another try and i actually want to thank you for even giving my works a shot. <br><br>you're doing really well, i know you are. just acknowledging you're healing and the fact that you're aware how suppression wouldn't help is already a step in freeing yourself of your fears and anxieties. take your time and breathe, and know that i'm rooting for you :)<br><br>luv u too~ thank you so much for dropping by!

      hi j! it's been awhile since the last time i dropped by on your cc. i've just realized i've read both of your ongoing long aus (sigil on my skin & life as we know it) until the last updates but haven't give my long ramblings about it. so here they are: <br><br>1. Sigil On My Skin 🧙‍♂️<br><br>from these updates i can see ji's little growth through the strong bond between sahi, mashi, and yoshi. he started to think he's not as great as he think he was. sarcastic remark suk gave him made ji realized the crowd that he had been proud of all along probably won't stay with him if he was in yoshi's position. the reason ji visited yoshi from my point of view probably because of guilt and he want to prove, either to suk or others or maybe to himself, he still has human decency, he's not self-center guy people think he is. so yeah up until now it's still not pure intention i guess. the creatures that walks the halls at night probably troll (the one hermione encountered) or dementor. those two are the ones that creep me out when reading harry potter.<br><br>this story is so good so far J! i hope there are more people who enjoy and appreciate it as much as i do.<br><br>2. life as we know it 👶🏻<br><br>"I'll still check on you from time to time" rereading this line from kyu remind me with a line from ji's story "the daisy, and the butterfly, and the sun that always watched and took care of them from behind". despite the sun seem faraway but it still protect & give his love to daisy and butterfly secretly. like what i was said in last cc, kyu seem the type of person who gave his affection toward his loved ones very subtle.<br><br>hanhan is the cutest when he just woke up. the way hanhan try to cheer up his wankul ji. the morning scene really has that domestic atmosphere. i love it and i feel so soft.  <br><br>jikyu slowly but sure walking to meet each other halfway. hanhan really mend their relationship and probably would be their reason to stay in the future. <br><br>i can't wait for next update. i became attached with hanjikyu. thank you for always making your readers connected with the characters you created, J. ☀️🌼🦋<br><br>3. Treasure hyung line interactive fic 🐷🐼🐯🐨<br><br>yes the angst tag is chosen, i'm one of those who chose that. lately i read angst au to get stress relieve. LMAO. 🤣<br><br>i also chose jikyu/yoshisuk, though i want my sukhoon and yoshihoon also sail. maybe you would consider Ji centric again hahaha.. and God please there's 7% who chose "jhour kill sumn then ot3" i love angst but i'm not that cruel. 😰<br><br>i guess that's all my rambling, it's getting late here so gnight J!<br><br>oh last one, i still reread the junkyu centric everytime i feel not myself, or when i feel lost. so thank you for that little reminder through that story. ☺️💛<br><br>- A ☀️🦊

LMAOOO JI CENTRIC just ot4 ending up together in a poly relationship ;A; the 7% probably are trolls lmaooo they thought im kidding huh :)<br><br>hope you had a great weekend, A!! :) <br><br>awh im glad the junkyu drabble is helping you &lt;3 you can always go back to it ok~ have a great week!

      hello jhour! just wanna let you know that you inspired me to write again🥺 deep down, writing has always been my passion, but because of the pressure of people’s expectations, i eventually stopped for ~4 years. i kind of associated my writing skills with my self-value. it has become my only source of validation (?) throughout those 4 years, i also gone through a lot of painful experiences that furthered my self-loathing. but somewhat, your au’s made me realize that i should write for myself—that writing in itself can be instrumental as i go through my process of growth. i am still learning how to love myself, so thank you very much for your works which have been really helpful for me. i don’t even read fanfics before, but i’m grateful i came across your “of suffering and other vices” on my tl. i have rediscovered my love for writing and will soon be making a writing acc of my own as a passion project where i can freely dump my creative juices without striving to always be “perfect” (also where i could transform my traumatic experiences into stories)💖✌🏻

      Part 4 of Venus <br><br>Aquarius: Junghwan<br><br>For Junghwan, he wants to be seen as someone who is free-spirited, visionary, and intellectual. “I’m a unique guy who will show you an unconventional path”. He’s giving people freedom to do what they want to do, especially if it involves exploring new ideas. Although he’s quite liberal, he still wants some structure in his life.  Sometimes he can appear as an aloof, standoffish, and flippant. He also struggles with facing confrontations, avoiding it like a plague. He’s also scared of displaying intense emotion out. He only trusts a few selected people, but he’ll ride or die with them. He likes to be with someone who can be his bestfriend, his companion in chasing his dreams, and someone who won’t restrict him. He might like art and stuff from the past and also stuff that are futuristic.<br><br>Pisces: Jihoon<br><br>Venus is exalted in Pisces. Although it’s not ruled by Venus like Taurus and Libra, it’s still going to thrive here (‘00L all have good Venus placements). Jihoon is a creative, intuitive, and dreamy guy. He wears his heart on his sleeve, compassionate, and capable of showing great empathy. He has a motto of “I love you just the way you are, and I just want you to be happy”. His love is an unconditional love, and he’s willing to make sacrifices for the ones he loved. He doesn’t care about superficial things, what matters to him is what a person is inside. He might appear too sensitive, and that’s because he feels emotion deeply. He’ll be attracted to gentle souls who need protection. One thing he needs to be careful of is projecting his imagination to people. Even though he can read people, he might be struggling to see people for what they really are, because he wants to see the good in people. If the image of a person and their bond in his head shattered, he might become resentful. Overall, Jihoon is a loving guy who gives love generously to people. He’ll be their support system, and asking little to none in return. He’ll be thriving in humanitarian activities, and he’s also good in creative activities like singing and dancing.<br><br>Whew, that’s a long ass explanation. I hope your brain won’t be fried reading all that 😅 Anyway, Yoshi showed his Mars in Gemini on the recent Tmap, grumbling over little grievances 😂. I was curious about Jaehyuk’s lucky strikes, and he has Mercury conjunct Sirius. I don’t know much about stars, but Sirius is a star with great power, so.... watch out for anything that comes out of Jaehyuk’s mouth. His words might hold some power in it.

OHFJKSDFH MARS IN GEM- youre making me so curious help ;A;  what does the mars placement mean? also mercury? sirius? you don't have to give me analysis on everything by the way &gt;&lt; i feel like it would be too much already. but thank you again &lt;3 <br><br>also do u mind if i ask, what's your venus placement? see you zodiac!! hope you'll have an amazing May ahead and don't forget to take care of yourself!! mwa

      Part 3 of Venus<br><br>Libra: Junkyu<br><br>Venus is also the ruler of Libra, like Taurus. For Junkyu, everything needs to be in balance and harmony for a relationship to work. “I’m a nice guy that will make sure everything is in harmony”. He’s kind, diplomatic, gentle, and willing to make relationship work. Whenever conflict arises, he’ll try to seek the middle ground. He has his own vision of love, and this is the area where he struggles. Oftentimes, relationships became his main focus more than himself and this can results in him neglecting himself. He wants to see beauty in everything, to the point that he might projects the fantasy he has in his mind. He might stay in a dying relationship for a long time, holding on to the hope that it’ll turn into the fairytale he has in his mind. Might gloss over the deeper issues in relationship, and very unhappy in an imbalance relationship. He’s attracted to someone that is gentle, elegant, and gives them words of affirmation. When he’s in love, he wants to spoil you and share things with you. As a Venusian, he has good artistic sense. He’s thriving in creative fields, like music and making arts.<br><br>Capricorn: Doyoung<br><br>Venus in Capricorn person is responsible, practical, and sensible. Doyoung is a hustler, with the mindset of “I show my affection by making things easier for you”. He shows love through helping you with practical matters, giving you gifts, and helps you plan ahead your finances. Because he wants to be a responsible and sensible person, he struggles in showing vulnerability. This problem could come from a rough childhood, when he kind of forced himself to be much more mature and responsible than people around his age. He dislikes having to rely on somebody, and likes to keep it cool when it comes to relationship. He can be warped up in trying to live up to people’s expectation, which can prevents him to enjoy the moment. In love, he’ll be attracted to someone that appreciates the things he has done, reliable, and faithful. He has good artistic sense, and loves high quality objects.

      Part 2 of Venus<br><br>Cancer: Asahi<br><br>Asahi’s Venus in Cancer might make him look stoic, but he’s actually.. a hopeless romantic. He’s nurturing, helpful, and always ready to give his shoulder to cry on, but struggles in showing vulnerability, keeping things bottled up inside. “I want love, but I’m afraid to wear my heart on my sleeve”. He’s very selective of who he keeps company because he can read people. He struggles with putting trust and relying others, and demands very little from people. But when he feels comfortable with someone , he’ll pour his hearts out and the other party might be shocked to find out the depth of emotion he has. He’s attracted to someone who is gentle, attentive, and able to interpret his needs. Loves cuddles and being taken care of. He could be a little bit possessive. He’ll spend a lot of money for his family or his home, as Cancer is a sign that has ties with home. His aesthetic is homey and romantic. Some people said that Venus in Cancer, along with Gemini and Leo, are good at making money.<br><br>Leo: Jeongwoo<br><br>Venus in Leo person, like Jeongwoo, is warm hearted and kind. He has this mindset of “I want to make you feel good, and I’ll go through great lengths for you”. Love is the most important thing for him, and he’s very generous. He’s a loving person, but struggles with his perception of worth, especially if he’s invested in something he loves. Oftentimes, he needs to seek validation from others to reaffirm his worth. He might also be struggling in seeing things clearly about things or someone he’s emotionally invested in. If he seems to be acting frivolous, it’s because he’s trying to put a front in order to protect himself from feeling hurt and keep things to himself. When he’s in love, he’ll serenade you, give you gifts, and brings you to a romantic dinner. He’s attracted to someone who can give him lots of affection, pamper him, and genuinely appreciates him.

      This is the first part of Venus series. I guess you can grasp the concept of rising sign now. Let’s move on to Venus. Venus is a planet of art, things you value (money, relationship, other material things), things you take pleasure in, and beauty. This is just a brief intro, now I’ll talk a bit about Treasure’s Venus sign.<br><br>Aries: Mashiho<br><br>Venus in Aries person prefers to show love in action rather than words, so Mashi will show his love through action. He has this “I want you and I will win you over” mentality. He’s ready to give all of him when he feels that the person is worth fighting for. Although he’s passionate in love chasing, he’s not a courteous person, and this could make him be in conflict with others. Love matters are usually being approached delicately, but he approaches it with cut and dry method. He might be struggling to balance out between being diplomatic and holding control. He’ll be attracted to a person who’s fun to be around, direct, and passionate. He might be an impulsive buyer. Likes bold arts.<br><br>Taurus: Yoshi<br><br>Venus is domicile in Taurus, a sign that constantly seeks sensory pleasure. Yoshi would spend money on things like food, any art he’s taken interest on, and luxury things to satisfy himself. In love, he needs security and dependability. “I’m a dependable guy, and going on a date with me means having a fine-dining in a cozy place”. Love needs to be expressed in a physical and steady way. Might become a possesive lover. Attracted to a person who is loyal, sensual, and able to be his companion when he wants to indulge in any sensory pleasure things. He might be struggling with giving too much but expecting too little. Take break-ups and losses a lot harder than anyone.<br><br>Gemini: Hyunsuk, Jaehyuk, Yedam, Haruto<br><br>Venus in Gemini people are versatile. They have wide range of interest and sets of skills. They’ll try to win people over with witty conversations, displaying their intelligence. People often regard them as flirty. “I fall in love with the mind first”. They love variety, stimulations, philosophical and intellectual diacussions. They’ll take you out of your comfort zone, explore things with you, and help you awaken something that is hidden inside you. They’re attracted to a witty, funny, and interesting person who keeps them guessing. They might be struggling with having emotional attachment, prefer to keep things light-hearted to protect themselves. They might shy away from people who showed them grand gestures. They’ll show love and create arts through love letters, poems, and song lyrics.

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> aaaa zodiac &lt;3 i posted your venus series in my twitter!! i just want to say damn,,, you can make such complex characters just knowing their birth charts. have you ever considered writing characters basing their characters on astrology? it's so interesting how in depth it can be, given that this is only one placement you're talking about.<br><br>i'll give some thoughts on what you sent although i apologize in advance since i can't be as thorough as you and i'd probably just sound like a fascinated child but here goes~<br><br>Aries:<br><br>tbh, i never saw mashi as the timid, shy type a lot of people seem to associate him with. he's more of a go getter for me, even during ygtb and it's interesting how his venus is in aries, also your analysis on it. sounds like a pretty slytherin trait for me, that's why i put him in slytherin for my hogwarts au haha<br><br>Taurus:<br><br>oooooooooh this is so interesting because i never saw Yoshi in this light. the kind where he'd spend money on luxurious things. also the security one screams so alpha male to me, and i didn't really see him that way. he's so squishy when it comes to showing his affection, or maybe because it's with treasure that we see, not an actual romantic partner. last sentence though, i could see it for him.<br><br>Gemini:<br><br>VENUS GEMINIS SOUND SO JKDHJKH &gt;:( DATE ME. sounds like the people i date tbh,, though this type could get tiring sometimes cos they'd dig deep in every little detail in the conversation even when you just wanna chill and relax.---okay wait a minute. im actually typing as i read and i just finished reading the whole paragraph,, why does this sound like me lmaoooo ;A; also still sounds like my type. i tend to be attracted to likeminded people

      Jihoonhour, Zodiac Anon here! This time, I’m going to explain a bit of information about rising sign & venus. It’s very long and needs to be breaken down, so bear with me.<br><br>Rising sign is a sign that is above the sky at the time you’re born. Basically, it sets the tone in your life, and also your appearance and vibe. It also determine the 12 houses and planetary position.<br><br>Let me use an example based on your chart. IIRC your rising sign is Libra. That means your chart ruler is Venus (Venus rules Taurus & Libra), and your Venus is located in Virgo (12th house). Venusian are usually good-looking and gives off elegant vibe. Since your Venus is in Virgo, you might have a small and slender frame. Since your ruler is in Virgo, you might resonate more with Virgo traits rather than your Leo traits. With Venus in Virgo, you’re someone that is able to create a compelling story with so much details, as Virgo placements are great writers. You have vivid imagination, and have a talent for world-building. You’re a very talented writer, but you have a tendency to bury down your works because you’re afraid of people seeing a part of yourself that is reflected in the fantasy stories that you wrote (because it’s in 12th house, it’s very hidden, yet your life revolves around matters in this house). You’re very comfortable building images in the unknown world, but you seldom let those close to you to see your work because you’re trying to protect the fantasy, the world that you built with your heart and soul.

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> aaa Zodiac anon, really sorry for the very very late reply cos my brain is always fried these days ;A; <br><br>i honestly don't know how to respond except to say that it's scary how it makes so much sense seeing the number of virgo placements in my birth chart &gt;&lt; idk if i told you but i do resonate with virgo more than leo (although i do have a lot of leo qualities as well sksk). <br><br>ALSO WHAT. that's literally why i'm so adamant on keeping my privacy here despite being anonymous. i don't really want my friends seeing my stories but at the same time i want to keep writing for other people as a form of an escape for me and the community here. very interesting insights. thank you so much for this :(

      Hello jhour! Hope you've been keeping safe, getting over your slump and are having a good time in general! I was actually wondering about your future plans for my absolute fav drabble aka hjw spidey 🥺 since you haven't spoken of it in a while, do you perhaps plan on discontinuing? :((( although it would mean utter heartbreak if you do so, i'll support your decision regardless ♡ but if you do plan on continuing sometime, no pressure! I wont keep asking, pls take your time hehe :D Once again, have a nice day!<br><br>P. S. Pls feel free to ignore if you've already answered similar questions by the time you come across this cc :D
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hello anon~ idk if you saw my tweet but i answered your question there hehe but i'll answer more thoroughly here. <br><br>like i said, i won't be discontinuing my works although i have some works in mind to put on hold until i finish Life As We Know It. hjw spidey will probably be updated sporadically, just keep an eye when i ask if people still read it, i'll probably update the day after :) <br><br>don't worry too much. i had a drabble before (dodam shipwars) which i continued after like four months haha,, i hope hjw spidey wont reach that point though so i'll try my best to finish it asap. <br><br>have a nice day too~  and take care!

      Jhour, Zodiac Anon here.<br><br>Finally you replied 🥺 No need to feel sorry for taking a long time, I know you’re exhausted and drained. I hope taking a time to rest for yourself will rejuvenate your mind, body, and soul.<br><br>Regarding the Junkyu drabble, I’ve also come to realization that some things are clearly not working for me anymore, and that’s fine. Nothing in life is static , the only thing that’s constant is changes itself. The drabble kind of giving different answers to different people. For some, it could be a suggestion to take a break and rediscover oneself, for others it could be a validation of what they’re feeling, for another group people it might be a sign to pivot. <br><br>I think that’s the beauty of creative writing, to be able to give people a perspective, make them interpret and reflect on the piece, and find the message that resonates with them. I’m glad to be able to find your writing acc in the middle of a time where the world needs healing.<br><br>About creative writing, I’ve written one but it’s still sitting in my draft because I just started a business in the beginning of April 😅 I’ll visit the draft soon.<br><br>Anyway, I promised you a long overdue Treasure Venus sign and a bit explanation of Rising sign. Since it’s going to be a lengthy post, I plan to drop another post in your cc. I’ll get back to you soon 😉

You're such a great writer and everytime that you update or upload drabbles and your aus, you never fail to amuse and make me feel great thru all of those. I just wanna say that I love you and thank you for everything even though I just watch you fight with anons and watch them propose to you. And one last thing ma'am will you marry me???

      hi jhour! this is a lil rant cuz i just read ur privatter on staying 🥸<br><br>i LOVED writing (and reading) esp in high school, and then had to stop completely to focus on my studies and 'productivity'. i graduated in a stem field too (outing myself as a hag too! hi!) but unfortunately in the middle of the p*ndemic (which forced me immediately to reevaluate my relationship with success and growth, and how PERSONALLY it was toxic or just simply unhelpful to me). i also had to reevaluate my future in stem completely.<br><br>this partially manifested in largely consuming and doing things which would only benefit my 'future career', which made me hate both reading and my planned career path even further. i fully had not written anything since high school... BUTTTT i re-ignited my passion for writing and reading due to your works!! i dont read fics but came across urs one day by chance (i was the anon a few weeks ago who read all ur completed works in ONE DAMN THURSDAY LMFAOOO) ive also started reading books i actually like again!<br><br>ive only recently started writing what i WANT and using it as a creative outlet, and i miss it so much u have no idea omg... granted im still unemployed and directionless lmfao BUT u ARE monumental in my journey of self discovery (and ive only been here for like a month too jesus...)<br><br>anyway this is getting too long so tldr: ur works have FULLY inspired me and know u and ur writing already have a net positive impact on me (and im 10000% sure on many others). so whatever u choose to do onwards know u have my full support! thank 💕

      hello jhour! i was wondering how you keep track of the traction for your works 🤔 do you do it manually, or is there perhaps an app or something of that sort that can help track and compile the engagements on your tweets? have a good day! ❤️
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> in general i just check the likes/quote rts. but twitter has a feature where you could check the analytics per tweet and the analytics for your whole acc :) i sometimes check that too. click the tweet and view tweet activity. for your account, click more in the nav bar then analytics.

      Jihoonhour, since you’re the queen of angst and you’ve taken a liking to Bobby, I want to recommend you iKON’s discography (especially Return album). They’re like the master of angsty story-telling, filled with well-thought lyrics. Maybe you can try to listen to their stuff from 2018 onwards if you want 😬

      im honestly typing this amid having a breakdown, idk what im feeling but im so tired of my life and i have no one to share this to bc i feel like my friends wouldnt understand me, and i feel like im gna be such a nuisance when i tell em this. the past month has been so hard and days are passing by slower and heavier for me. i cant even pinpoint the exact reason why im feeling like this. i just feel like you need to know that whenever nights like this comes, i always find myself scrolling through your works. you and your words help me in so many ways i cannot explain. thank you for everything, jhour.

      I read the letter that you’re possibly leaving this app. Ngl, it made me sad to see that one of my favorite person is leaving but it also made me happy that you are choosing you. It takes a lot of strength and courage to be focusing on yourself to be better yk. I’m proud of you either way. I’m proud of all your works and I’m proud that you are making efforts for yourself in every way that you can. Thank you for watering my dry ass life these past months.

      Dear Jhour,<br><br>I've read your hiatus notes. I just wanna say thank you for writing great stories that most of the times can calm the hurricane inside my mind and give me comfort. I've found your stories this year, how I wish I found you sooner. I know the adulthood path is unpredictable, tiring, and most of the time rocky as hell, because currently I'm on that path too, but I truly wish you will always have all the support and strength to tackle all those obstacles ahead. And I wish you will always find the way to see the ray of sunshine after every storm you must endure. When you decide to come back writing I will happily welcome you. So, see you when I see you, J. ☺️🌼🧡<br><br>- A☀️🦊<br><br>PS: Pssst... An hour ago Rosie released the Gone MV!!!! Her beauty is really ethereal!!

      Hi J it's me again dropping by here! I hope you don't get bored getting lot of my rambles that sometimes written too long hahahaha.. 🤣<br><br>I've read Constellations and You Sukhoon AU. As usual I really love how you put methapors in every story you wrote. It's written beautifully as expected. 🧡<br><br>My favorite (and probably lot of your other readers agree with me) lines in the story is:<br><br>"Jihoon wasn’t just a constellation, he was the universe in human form." ✨<br><br>I think at some point people would have someone who is their universe, where they become the stars that floating around them not knowing the universe would lose their grip and made the stars fall fast, hard, and burned themselves. 🌠<br><br>Hahaha sorry for my morning rambles I just got a lil bit sentimental this morning, probably because today is monday. haha 🤪<br><br>Have a nice week ahead J!<br><br>- A☀️🦊

      After I joined the kpop community, I found myself reading fanfics/imagines soon and then eventually wanted to write my own as well. However that lasted for a short while. Now, I started reading aus a few months back (aus&gt;&gt;&gt;imagines)  and I found you (I used to read other group’s ffs but then I stumbled upon treasure aus and I fell in love, esp with the ones you write) and I can’t explain how deeply your aus affect me. They’re not just a learning point for me but have also been making me want to write treasure aus too! And this time I really want to! I’m just waiting to get over with my exams and then I hopefully will post! Thank you for being so admirable jhour!

She's also busy promoting in variety shows, I'm happy for it! YG surely became better in promoting their artist.<br><br>For Jihoon bday drabble I laugh while reading it, and the maknaes is really scary with whatever they're planning (looked like the set the dorm on fire 🤣🤣🤣). Hhahahhaha<br><br>Yes yes yes I really hope Lili solo will happen in the summer, but whenever it is I'm ready to hype her up too!!!

      Hi J! Welcome back! 🤣 Hahaha that's okay I know from your tl you've been pretty busy irl.<br><br>1. Life as we know it - I've just finished reading your update. I still can't figure it out their past that holding them back from each other until now. But my guess it's from misunderstanding that piled up bit by bit because of their polar opposite characters. 🤔 Kyu looked like someone that prioritize his goals first above everything, and on top of that he's someone that show affection toward his loved ones in a very subtle way almost unnoticed. On the other side Ji looked like someone who give everything he has for his loved one, became their pillar constantly but refuse to let others knowing that he need them too. It felt like Ji the one who left Kyu before, however they're hurt as much as the other. 💔 I hope they will have a proper talk and stop doing the push & pull moves.<br><br>2. HJW spideyboy - If Dobby knew Woo is going to the crime scene, I bet he would be ready to make a scene with the KoreaGovt for sure. 🤣<br><br>3. Haruhwan Tie You To Me - OH.MY.GOD.J. <br><br>I always love AU with soulmate genre, the red string one, the color rush one, the tattoo one, but Tie You To Me is like how I should put it in words? Softly and sweetly mesmerizing! You really write it beautifully like you always do with your other works. Haruhwan AUs would be your fluffiest works I read hahaha (not complaining tho). Their love is so innocent I really want to treasure it when reading it. 🧡<br><br>4. Sukhoon Sigil on My Skin - HAHAHHAHA that's okay, but better you make a very long update to compensate that. hahha jk J. 😆<br><br>5. Other recent Fluff Drabbles:<br><br>I am a bit surprised when you posted some drabbles which most of them are fluff hahaha but I really enjoy all of them. I've reviewed the junkyu centric & sukhoon in my previous cc.<br><br>a. HJW Time & Space <br><br>I'm glad you made the sequel of it. I've got teary eyes & a bit heartbroken reading the first one.<br><br> “My mom said sometimes people retain the memories of their past, when their soulmate hurt them in their previous life," this idea of soulmate is both beautiful & hurt at the same time.<br><br>b. Jikyu Act Natural<br><br>Jikyu is the cutest here, like everyone except themselves know how love dovey they are as "bestfriends" even mashi said they're practically married for years hahahaha... 😆 This Jikyu love is the heartwarming one and make you feel younger (although I'm not that old 😂)<br><br>c. Yoshikyu Drawing Heartbeats<br><br>This one is really sweet and funny. I feel the secondhand embarassment when kyu said "I'm crying because I can't understand" what a lame excuse HAHAHHA sorry kyu. 🤣<br><br>You can call me A or Ayane, whichever to your liking and convinience. And also from now, I will put lil signature of mine in the end of my rambles to you, to make it easier for you to recognize me. 😂<br><br>I read in your other acc about you're considering to take indefinite hiatus. I will support & respect whatever your final choice is, J.<br><br>- A☀️🦊

      hello! just wanted to say how much i appreciate your jikyu’s life as we know it au :( it always makes me feel sad, it’s just so sad. my heart always cries for the both of them, hoping, hoping, if only they decided to let it all out then they wouldn’t be hurting like this 😭 i feel so sad whenever i feel hoonie’s loneliness and how much he misses his bestfriends and of course how much he misses having kyu as his (well, is he ever his?) but no it kyu’s also making my heart ache 😭😭😭 i hope he knows how worthy he is and how jihoon saw how much of a great person he is. i hope they soon 😭😭😭 find their way back into each other’s arms again 😭😭😭 though i feel like it’s really gonna happen just give kyu a little bit more time. kyu, hoonie loves you so so so so much! :( thank you so much for updating this au again, i really love this, it’s remarkable to me. funny how the movie this au is based on is literally my favorite too 😭 ahh please know that i really appreciate your aus and i look up to your writing but you don’t have to beat yourself with people’s praises. we’re here to support you in whatever pace you choose &lt;3

      Hi jhour..just wanna share interesting things I've found. Have you ever come across manga titled 'Hamster' by Ji Chuan Liu?  or 'Wolf Butler And His Cat Master'? I don't know why but I got the same feeling of reading au when I was reading the manga. And since you are my favorite au writer, naturally I wanna share this with you. Try to read it if you have time ok. It is cute and fluff.

      Hi ji, I become your fan very recently, I really enjoyed all of your writings. I've been meaning to reach you through dm, but you're current in a closed doors as of the moment. I'm in my early 20s, 3rd year college to be exact. But idk, i just felt so lost these days, pressures are weighing me down. 'til know, I'm still not discovered my passion and my purpose, i cannot figure it out. can you give me a piece of advice?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hii, sorry for the late response. you could also reach me through privatter (if you want to reveal yourself through a personal message system) but i actually respond slower there too &gt;&lt; haha<br><br>well, i don't really think i'm the best person to ask this because i'm way past uni and i'm still lost hahahaha,,, but ok i'll try to be as coherent as possible with this advice;<br><br>don't force yourself too much at the given moment. i'm not saying don't try to find what your passion truly is, but try to tread through everything carefully. it's hard to make choices when we think of our future in the line, but if we force ourselves there's a high possibility we end up being more lost.<br><br>reflect on yourself first before taking action. maybe think of the things and activities that make you happiest, and go from there. the process of finding it may be short or long, it really depends, but one thing's for sure; it's definitely okay to take your time. <br><br>just remember you don't have to live in other people's social clock. do everything at your own pace since you're still young and there would always be room to find yourself.

      Hello jihoonhour, Zodiac Anon here.<br><br>I’m sorry for taking so long to respond, real life was hectic as hell. I’ll make another post on your cc about Venus placement, but right now I’m just going to talk about the Junkyu Hurt/Comfort Drabble you posted.<br><br>I can relate to the Junkyu in the story, the story had me tearing up. In fact, I have the same conversation between Junkyu and Jihoon with my best friend.<br><br>The heartache feeling, I know it really well. The things you believed in are shattered, the utopia you dreamed of just turned into ashes, you feel disconnected to the things you once loved, and all that’s left is emptiness. You know you have to pick yourself up again, but you have no idea on how to function like you were before. The internalized pain is slowly eating your soul.<br><br>My best friend encouraged me to open my heart and not afraid to be vulnerable. Remember that I told you about my desire to write? Another reason for that is so that I can find myself again. I know I’m not good with verbal communication, that’s why I’m trying to learn on how to convey my thoughts and feelings with written words. The story just gave me a little push to publish the draft I had written, so thank you for writing the story :)

I'm not trying to romanticize our misery, but our efforts are not in vain especially when we heal through them, and let others be healed as well.<br><br>I'm really glad we found each other in the process of finding ourselves again :) and yes omg the creative class, how is it going? aaaaa im so happy!! maybe my drabble was a sign from the universe for u to publish it hehe jkjk,, im gonna cry i need to catch up with your works, but know that i will always be your biggest fan and no one can take it away!! no one!!!! /j<br><br>you're welcome,, and i wont get tired of thanking you for everything you've thought me these past few months &lt;3 thank you for dropping by here~  take your time with the venus placement mwa

      Hi J! It's me dropping by again here. I've read your two latest drabbles, Junkyu centric & Sukhoon. I've cried & smiled tonight because of both stories. <br><br>1. Junkyu Centric<br><br>This story just hit close to home. There were a lot of times I thought things like Kyu said in the story: <br><br>“I don’t know even know myself,” Junkyu chuckled wetly, “it’s like suddenly I don’t know why I’m doing all of this in the first place,”<br><br>Last year was the peak of that worst feeling. Everything at work felt too overwhelming, frequent burnout, sometimes crying myself to sleep, other times just staring blankly into space can't even shed a single tears. Then I found Treasure, somehow they heal me though not completely. And also I've found comfort this year through reading AUs where yours are ones of my fav. So Yeah just like the last sentence of the drabble, all I need to do is owning myself again and I'm in the long journey to reach that destination. Like Kyu who has Ji staying by his side, I have my lil sis do that part for me. So thankyou J for making this beautiful story, it's some kind of soft reminder to myself. 🧡<br><br>2. Sukhoon<br><br>Drunk!Ji is just so cutie dumb adorable, I understand why Suk can't resist him. It feels like another bonus episode of To All The Boys I've Loved Before AU even the title literally screaming about it. I can't stop smiling & giggling while reading this. I can't believe you can be so fluffy J, I almost can't recognize you anymore. Jk. 😆<br><br>Anyway thankyou for the updates J, it's kinda cheer me up after having another rough day.  🧡☺️<br><br>PS: sorry for another long ramble again I cant help it 🤣

NO I LOVE YOUR REVIEWS KEEP THEM COMING

      I wonder why you write fanfic au... cause im pretty sure you can build a very well written character like hana, any specific reason you choose fan fiction?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> i actually have original works but they're more on the fantasy/scifi genre (i barely have romance, mundane writings in my folders before i started writing fanfiction). i used to publish them on a website [fictionpress] years ago but since ao3 has become more mainstream while i was away in the writing community, it's hard to find an audience for specific original works.<br><br>if you follow my author's notes, you'll know that a huge part of my motivation comes from talking about my stories with someone because it stimulates my brain to come up with more ideas. with this, having an audience became a vital part for me to push myself to post updates and write.. and here comes kpop head smashing its way to my life along with discovering the writing community it has. i mean, it's a win win to be honest, writing about something you love.<br><br>of course if you think about it, all my characters are just,,, characters. so it doesn't matter if hana's well written, because in my opinion, jihoon, junkyu, and all my other characters in my other works regardless if they're original or they take up a name of an idol, are complex too since i'm an author who focuses on characterization. they all have different background stories and personalities that makes them, /them/. you just have to dissociate themselves from the people they are based on and think of these characters as someone entirely different.<br><br>you could technically just change all their names with one click in the document and call it an original work sksk<br><br>i don't really think it matters much if i write fanfiction or original works. because at the end of the day, what matters is the message i try to put across them and how it's perceived by my readers. <br><br>writing is an art that takes different forms :)

      hi jhour hahaha!!! it's 12am here in my region but i just got time to give the whole essay i promised you few days ago. mind you that it's gonna be so long, it'd be a lot of typos also, might as well some sentences r grammatically wrong lol lol. but i'm just really scared if it's gonna be too late, so here you go. <br><br>jhour i'm not really sure if i've said this in your modern royalty's qrts, but if i did just pretend you hasn't read that haha. it's about the 2020 that became the hardest year to get through, i'm not even exaggerating when i said from august to the end of the year i have to let go so many things, too many people i once glued myself with their presence, that made me feel like i'm losing myself. then one night, i randomly search for an au in twitter, and your works was the first thing that catched my attention. to all the boys i've loved; it was a good distraction, a free escape to let my mind rest for awhile, just much more like a free entertainment that makes me smile to my sleep (sigh that was cringey but that actually happened lol). the following morning, i read the other works; jihoon centric drabble. maybe you've heard this a lot of time from me, but i treasure that drabble so much, simply because it taught me the art of letting go. that one line in the epilogue played like a broken record at the back of my mind "sometimes your greatest love wasn't your one true love. and that's okay' so i tried to let things go, not just to set them free, but also to give myself the peace it deserves. so in sum, thank you for helping me through the healing process.  we're technically strangers, but i'll be forever thankful for your presence in this world. <br><br>the moment when you lose your friend makes me remember myself. there's something so sorrowful yet beautiful about living with the embodiment of someone who no longer with us. I’ve been there, and there’s also a lot of moment where I’m so scared I can’t treat them the way they deserve to be loved. But jhour, as the time goes by I’m sure you’ll learn, like I do. So remember this, you’re gonna be a good goddaughter because you have all the chance to learn. So take your time. Make it as you go.<br><br>Last but not least, just like how I found a peace in your works, I hope you found peace in your writing activity also. I’m so proud of you and I love you so much, I’ll always do.<br><br>The paragraph didn’t even connected to each other lol lol, but that’s what I wanted to say. There’s actually a lot of things I didn’t mention, but it’ll be too long so maybe I’ll drop another one when I had a time. Good night jhour, sleep well &lt;3

      the fact that I was in junkyu's place last year, I didn't know what I was doing, what I'm supposed to do here, everything was what's, why's, and what ifs. even thinking was so hard for me, I want to share my problems to others but I'm afraid that I will hurt people bcoz my words can really hurt someone that's why I kept it in my mind. everything was so perfect before but then this sudden wave of sadness yet it doesn't feel like that, I didn't actually feel anything I'm just blank, blank like my heart. I didn't care about everything, it's so hard trying to make myself feel like me again. I was thinking of stopping swimming cause my body does not listen to me anymore, I love to swim but— I really hate this feeling, this feeling where I think that I am capable of doing it but my mind, it's like controlling the other me, the not me. that is why I am trying to be happy again but there is still a hole which is I cannot explain because I don't know myself anymore. but I still feel like swimming in a undefined pool. I can't explain it properly, I'm sorry I don't really know myself anymore.

      Hi jhour~ I actually have a concern, so I have been writing a few aus. But nowadays whenever I want to continue my ongoing aus, I get so overwhelmed and ended up closing the tab off. Do you have any advice or tips that I can work on?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hello did i just ghost write this for myself? haha on a serious note, what i've been doing these days is to take a lot of rest, and go through other hobbies that make me feel calm (meditation, gardening, journaling, etc.) or if it works for you too, maybe try to write one shots so you can write and close the document the same day if you have the urge to write something.<br><br>i understand how overwhelming ongoing works can be. planning the next chapters, the progression etc. but just remember to take things slow so you won't be anxious trying to continue it. you can look up the chunking method as well, basically it's grouping smaller tasks (in our case as writers, smaller scenes into chapters). you'll find that once you push past the initial resistance to write that one single scene, you'll find it easier writing scene after scene. <br><br>don't force yourself to write :) open the document when your mind is clearer and more calm to produce work you'll be satisfied with.<br><br>hope this helps and just reach out if you wanna ask about anything else. all the best!

      hi miss jihoonhour!! when i’ve read your junkyu drabble, the first song which came first into my mind was what once was mine (the healing incantation in tangled). the song was about bringing back something from the past that has been lost, which also relates to the drabble, for all junkyu wanted was to bring the reflection of his old self back. also, i haven’t experienced finding life too arduous yet because i’m still young and there’s more to life than just school activities and stuff. however, i just wanna thank you for writing stories like these and sharing your thoughts to all people who can read your works. to be honest, it feels so good knowing that someone’s out there reaching out to your soul and emotions through words and writings— as if wanting to give you home and comfort after being fed up of being too tired to accept how reality is making emptiness difficult to bear with, and you’re there, connecting with the emotions of the displaced souls through your drabble. when the people sent you ccs about them finding ease and comfort by reading your work, they were never wrong. also, in addition, my favourite work of yours is writers (adam drabble). it’s because you’ve taught me that it’s always myself over anyone else. it made me realize that life is all about a game of choices to the point i’ll have to face dilemma between picking myself or letting go of the only thing that makes me feel alive just for somebody else. i’m amazed at how your mind can change someone’s point of view in life. please continue writing until the end! no writer has ever touched my emotions this way. have the best days!! i’ll always support your works &lt;3
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> oh i love tangled :( and that song could be a lullaby tbh, i need a longer version of it hehe~ it's so nice knowing you connected that to the drabble since the atmosphere of the song is kinda contrasting. still, there's a certain type of melancholy in both of them. i love it.<br><br>if i'm gonna be honest i actually read your cc the day you sent it, and forgot most of its content until i read it again today. and let me tell you, you made me cry at twelve in the morning with your words (and making me cry again right now). i actually started writing to bring myself back again from a depressive episode, and i'm so so glad i have this kind of reach right now, because somehow even for a little while i'm helping others cope with theirs through things i learned myself. you guys will always be welcomed in this safe space of ours and i'm glad we found each other through here :)<br><br>oh the adam/yesahi drabble :) a classic. lemme tell you another secret, i realized that during a brink of a break up, how me and my ex shouldn't change an integral part of ourselves just to fit each other. you will learn along the way, but sometimes my works aren't actually applicable for everyone's situations. sometimes we have to sacrifice a part of ourselves, if needed. i, too, am still learning :) you can always reach out to my works for guidance, but at the end of the day our journeys will be different, and it's definitely okay to learn in different paths.<br><br>you're still so young but you're already very articulate with your words~ hehe :) thank you so much for reaching out! i don't think i'll stop writing any time soon :) see you around and i hope you have a great week ahead!!

      Hi miss jhour! I finished the junkyu drabble, it was very well written! The message and emotions definitely came across, i felt it. I think a lot of us had gone through similar situation, so i just thought I'll share mine hehe<br><br>For me, the worst experience was the last year of my high school. Nothing bad happened - that time was honestly the peak of my high school career. Yknow, good grades, winning competitions, leading programmes, known by people. But I guess those were what pushed me to become... heavy. Alive, successful, but not quite content with it. And it's just like what you described; the painful feeling of not being able to feel anything. Numb. <br><br>Unlike Junkyu though, I didn't have anyone who could help me out sksksk well even I didn't notice as I slowly pushed people away and building up a wall. Until one day, I went out with my sister to try out new things (kinda like a hobby) and at the end of the day she pointed out : "I thought you didn't enjoy what we did today because your eyes seemed lifeless."<br><br>I couldn't sleep that night lmao it was bothering me that I should feel happy, but couldn't feel it. I dug inside myself, what actually was bothering me?<br><br>It was loneliness. And to tell the truth it always loneliness that bothers me every step i take.<br><br>The better my grade, the higher I get, more and more admiration turned to me. As well as jealousy, because they're kinda inseparable. And really, I couldn't care less about what others think about me, except if it's someone close.<br><br>It's just that the people closest to me at that time thought the same. That I was exceptional, on another level, that I was different. It made me lonely to think that they couldn't understand me, because who else could if not the one I put trust in? I felt... disconnected. Because the one they saw was the image of myself that I built, one I expected them to see through because they were with me behind the scene.<br><br>Once I realize and acknowledge that feeling, I took the step to tell people how I feel and those conflicts that happened in my head. Uh, they probably never understood how much that discovery meant for me, but it was my breakthrough. The moment that I realize the heavy, numb feeling in my chest can go away, albeit slow, but it can go. <br><br>I still do feel the same loneliness from time to time. Maybe someday I'll find my soulmate that'd understand sksksksk it's not that serious though<br><br>That was long and a bit dark im sorry hshsh maybe i should write this longer and turn it into a whole story plot 😭 i can make this shorter but idk i just want to make it dramatic lmao if you really read this thank you 😂

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hi! :) sorry for the late reply :( i hope you still see this though.<br><br>your cc. oh my lord. it feels like my fifteen year old self ghost wrote that. i know you're not asking for advice, so i'll just tell a little bit of my own story too, in case you can pick up something from it.<br><br>just like you i was an overachieving high schooler, student council, was part of the top etc, however that's when my depression started to form. i'm not exactly sure back then how it suddenly took place; the pressure to please, the pressure to stay on top, perhaps. but i was doing fine with it, high functioning, albeit pretty badly when i'm alone.<br><br>so when i started to open up to my closest friends about it, my feelings, loneliness, my beliefs; it felt like a slap on the face when not one of them understood, which only made me wary of all the relationships and friendships that came to my life from that point on. <br><br>fast forward to now, past college, waay past high school, having the same set of close childhood friends but a different level of maturity, i now understand that perhaps these types of emotions were experienced by us way earlier than our peers. i tried to understand why i couldn't get the kind of support system i needed when i was younger, and realized that maybe our friends didn't know how to respond to emotions they're not familiar with. <br><br>because as we grew up, with a different set of problems, being more mature, going past different relationships, them realizing what loneliness truly meant, it's easier for me to talk to them about it. although not entirely, still.<br><br>sometimes i still find it hard opening up my thoughts to certain people, that's why i turned to writing. i understood that perhaps our loved ones never truly meant to dismiss our feelings, they're just not the right people, maybe for now, or maybe not at all. we need to understand that just because we love someone, doesn't mean they're on the same wavelength as us. and that's definitely okay. we still love them, and they still love us.<br><br>we just need to find the right people to talk to about certain things. and i hope you find the kind of support system you deserve, anon. in the mean time, during your search for your soulmate, you can reach out to me should your thoughts drown you during the day :)<br><br>if you decide to write it as a story, send it to me if you're comfortable enough to share it hehe :) see you around, and i hope happiness will find you again.

      hi jhour i know i should tell you this in qrts or in dms but i just can't sksksk thank you for this drabble. i don't "vibe"(??) with junkyu now but sometimes i completely understand how he feels. i often think that i'm just doing it to tick the box and i procrastinate most of my time because i just don't have a motivation to do anything and tell everyone that i'm just being lazy. but it's not about me rn. this drabble is very beautiful and meaningful. i had to take some time to think about it. i don't like angst in general but i LOVE your angst because it always hits right on target and it hurts but at the same time so comforting. beautiful pain. thank you so much for your works for being you and i hope one day you'll feel fully happy! i love you have a great day &lt;3

      Hi jhour. Despite the tags, i still read your junkyu drabble. It felt like im reading my own story through your words. And i took comfort from it. <br><br>I'm a junior architect. i was on top of my class. and they believe that i am the best of my batch. I liked the recognition before but the weight of their expectations drowns me. Im afraid that might hate the things i love to do before. I kept losing my creative side. I can't design now that i have all the chance. I want to cry my heart out for months but I can't seem to do it because i dont have the tears. But thank you. I finally cried for what i yearned to cry for for the past months. Im not healed tho thank you for the comfort i got.

      Idk if it's the same but i relate to ur junkyu drabble so much. I have an okay job, complete fam, great friends, great bf but idk y do i feel empty? I sound so ungrateful. But this drabble made me realize that maybe i feel empty because i dont really get to be fully me on a daily basis. Im a diff me at work, im a diff me at home, im a diff me with friends, im a diff me when im w my bf. I forgot the last time i was able to fully be myself. Maybe that's the reason y im so unmotivated lately even tho im not really facing any problems or what. Anyway thank you for this drabble jhour. It kinda validated what im feeling.

      You must watch it J, in the video star Ji admitted he already had a first love, he's too honest.

DURING TODAY LUNCH BREAK I WATCHED IT AND LITERALLY SCREAMING TO JOY! All of the elements are perfect, the beat, the lyric, the visual (OMG the MV shots are just mesmerizing!!), Rosie's highnote then the beat drop after that just purrrfeeeect, and of course The Park Chaeyoung herself is just perfect!! I keep replaying 'On The Ground' and 'Gone' one repeat!!! 😭☺️💖<br><br>I just notice probably there would be 'Gone' MV because we got its teaser video first!!! And if Rosie perform both songs in music show and she sings 'Gone' with her guitar, istg it would be the death of me!!! 😭💖<br><br>By the way, are you planning making Jihoon (any ships or maybe another Jihoon centric) AU based on Rosie song to celebrate Ji's bday and also Rosie solo debut?<br><br>Yes both Ji & Rosie really makes me want to do better with my life! 🧡 For Lili's solo probably this year too with the way the new management works so far. 🤔 And Jisoo's solo I heard it would be at least next year, but that's okay we got Snowdrop this year! But If YG dare to delay it years again I will... 🔪💣🔪💣🔪<br><br>BLINKTEUME 4EVAAA LMAO 😆

      Things has been pretty hectic this week, so I've just finished reading your updates J. Here are my reactions for those updates:<br><br>1. Jikyu Long AU: First of all, talkative Hanhan is super duper cutie fluffy squishy! ☺️😖 Jikyuhan is the most devastatingly adorable combination. 💔☺️ Ji's story is just that beautiful. How he told Hanhan the first time he met his parents, the storms that symbolize the tragedy that happened to gon & hana, the way daisy (ji) longing for the sun (kyu) while the sun just always leave him alone/ignore him, but in the end the sun come back to take care his new butterfly along with Daisy. ☀️🌼🦋 Wow I just love & live for your wordplay as usual J! I was holding my breath while reading the last narration. Like Ji said I feel content, but scared. Scared of another angst you would bring to the table J! 😂 Great updates as usual! ☺️🧡<br><br>2. Hjw drabble: You know what, I used to think Dobby is the genius one in the room, turns out Woo really outsmart him. 🤣 Dobby's main priority is his matching socks istg this kid. 🤣 The way Dobby got you're-so-funny-zoned by Damie. 💔 Woo really try his best to make Ruto being honest with him although his way is stupid & dangerous. And seriously agree with Dobby, the govt really make spideyboy going to dangerous places while it should be their job as adults, duh. 🤦<br><br>3. Haruhwan one tweet pic: I hope it will get &gt;200 likes asap, so it will entry the loooong drabbles queue like the harudam. 🤣 I'm soft with haruhwan after today Tmap ep. 💙  <br><br>I can't wait for tonight Sukhoon Long AU update! I have a hunch our Headboy would take a visit too to the infimary. 🤔😉<br><br>Also, I want to answer your question in twitter here because ofc I'm on priv 😂 My fav stories from jihoonhour:<br><br>1. Long AU: At first it was Modern Royalty, because angst, angst, angst, and angst (you really made Ji suffered in that story J! 🤣). Currently, it's tied between Life As We Know It (Hanhan balance the angst in it 👼) and Sigil On My Skin (I love the chars dynamic and ofc because I'm a potterhead ⚡)<br><br>2. Drabbles: I have my top 3 for this one, Haruhwan Maknaes (it's so soft & fluffy and I can really picture Haru playing with Hwanie 😖), Dodam Shipwar (I love my dumb dumber couple! LMAO), and Jihoon Centric The Four Times He Fell In Love (I cried reading this one, and I love all of 4 relationship dynamics)

      Jhournim I leave reviews for your works in my private account but the recent jikyu update made me want to say it here. It's my first time reading rps and decided to give your story a go with an open mind. Joining the hype would probably be the best thing I did as I binge read your works over the week (you won't be able to see because I'm on private). The depth and substance of your stories and the meaning behind them reflects how beautiful your soul is. You're humble, funny, and your way with words made me fall in love. Love at first read does that exist? Lol. I see how everyone around here loves you so much. Continue doing what you love and know that you just gained another admirer.

      Here's my lil theory for the jikyu au!<br><br>Is it jihoon's fault or junkyu's fault? Or someone else?<br><br>1. Jihoon : a thing that caught me is hyunsuk's conversation with junkyu at the restaurant, which he said jihoon love to take care of something - someone. But then he's still confused with jihoon, and junkyu gave up understanding long ago. I think there's a sentence about ji need to realize some flower wont fully bloom(?) Maybe ji need to realize just because he take care of somehing not necessarily will turn out like he want it to be<br><br>2. Junkyu : i think he's very focused on his self growth and career. When they first met, he mentioned that boy can wait, his future can't. He also prioritize work before family day, and said baby and business should be kept separate. But he still do care about people around him, he just express it less. Also, he mentioned he cant focus on more than one thing, which is why (i assume) he stop performing and cant pursue education and love at the same time.<br><br>Maybe, they couldn't understand each other. Maybe jihoon spend a lot of time trying to make it work but junkyu focused more on his own growth, so it create a misunderstanding that junkyu doesnt care. Maybe at some point ji took care of other people and junkyu got jealous because he seem to do that often. They both seem to still like each other, so i think the reason behind their fallout must be some kind of misunderstanding or clash in opinion, because your writing indicate that jihoon cant understand junkyu, and junkyu cant understand jihoon. They admired each other but cant grasp what's in each other's mind.<br><br>And here comes hanhan! I think when ji's able to pour his care on the baby, his need to take care of something can be satisfied and not depend on junkyu anymore, letting him see the situation clearer that junkyu actually care but has other things he wanted to do. Junkyu, on the other hand, would learn how to manage his time and priority because he cant choose between work and hanhan, he just going to make it work somehow.<br><br>This might be far fetched lmao anyway i enjoyed the story so far and excited for more 🤩  thank you for the great stowy

      Hi jhour! I read your carrd and saw that you've been in a writing rut for 5 years. You don't have to answer if it's too personal but I just want to ask why and how you got out of it? You're making me want to go back to writing again and I don't know if I will yet but I wanted you to know you're the biggest factor in pulling me back. Take your time with the updates because we'll wait for it! Stay safe and much love ♡
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> oh, my earlier readers know this but i don't actually have proper writing experience. i did write for fun before (years prior), just like now, however i had more free time back then. uni happened which sucked the living shit out of me, mental health problems, etc. <br><br>i focused on getting my engineering degree and afterwards my work (do u see the timeline now haha). let's just say quarantine hasn't been the most helpful at keeping certain thoughts in check, and it finally gave me some time to do something else. i wasn't the happiest and i've had a lot of thoughts going back to things that used to make me happy; which mainly includes writing. <br><br>technically it wasn't a "writing rut", per se, but more of, i didn't have enough time before and now it's presented to me. basically i just needed that initial push to post my works out there, regardless if i wasn't following proper syntax, practices etc. i just write for fun and knowing people resonate with my works is enough for me to write again :)<br><br>i guess just take your time. have a healthy relationship with hobbies you like, don't think you're forcing yourself to write for the sake of producing something. write for yourself and for the people that resonate with you and your works, and you'll get the right push to write another day :)<br><br>see you around! &lt;3

      hello!! im not sure if anyone asked this before, but i’m curious about your au writing process. since you write the updates as they come, do you just go with the flow or do you already have a plot line in mind? thank you for answering, looking forward to all your updates!!!
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> i only plot the outline before updating. i already have outlines for multiple chapters, sometimes until the epilogue.<br><br>example of chapter outline:<br><br>[hogwarts au]<br><br>prologue -  introduce ji and suk, jihoon's personality, explain ji's annoyance, potions scene where jihoon fucks up<br><br>yeah that's basically what i have before i write everything the day itself sksk. dialogues, setting, word flow, and other things are just written on the spot. when i post the next update for quite some time (~10 mins) it means im still writing lmaooo<br><br>even for the one tweet fics, most of them already have full plots in my head when i post them, just not full blown verbalized yet :) thanks for the interesting question! and see you around~

      hi jhour just wanna drop by to somehow share how the butterfly short story captured me, like at first it was kinda hard for me to understand cause i knew within those words there were much more meaning and thought into it, but back to what captured me is the part where the leaves was given which for me symbolized sacrificing a part of you in order for others to grow. although this night was such a fluffy night due to our babie hanhan the story gave it more depth, ily my j, take care!!

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> okay i posted this in my twitter already and im so happy you picked it up :) there are a lot of other hidden meanings there too that could allude to their past, so maybe u might wanna reread it again~ <br><br>hehe always balancing it with hanhan fluff ;) ily j &lt;3 thank you for dropping by and take care too!

      Hello!! It's me again 😅. You suggested that I read the long aus and I decided to read sigil on my skin since I had some time and I managed to keep up with it in less than an hour and read until the latest chapter (I'm a pretty fast reader but then again, there weren't that much to read 😅). I really love your plot though bcoz it just makes me wanna keep reading and knowing what's gonna happen next. Hyunsuk's character is very interesting and I can't wait to know more about his character. Ohh and I can't wait to see what role Mashi and Asahi is gonna do in this au. Same goes to other characters. I was sad that it was not completed yet but that's okay. I'll read your other works while waiting and I can't wait for you to update sigil on my skin. I might drop by again to review your other works 🤭
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> oh sigil on my skin and life as we know it are currently ongoing :) are you a potterhead too? &lt;3 hyunsuk's one of the mysterious wizards in there but mashi and asahi as slytherins are close seconds. i love their characters so much (even though i havent shown much of them yet). Other characters will be introduced soon too &lt;3<br><br>my complete long aus are:<br><br>- to all the boys (i think you've read this one?)<br><br>- badboy x goodboy<br><br>- modern royalty<br><br>the last one is the longest + it has three side stories so have fun reading that one!! looking forward to seeing your reviews &lt;3

      1. The way you push the update to tomorrow I have a hunch you prepare some Angst feast in the next update. I can't wait for it 🤣 <br><br>2. What I've comprehend unti now, Ji in the past watched on his own eyes some witch/wizard battle i guess (?) People losing control over themselves & blood everywhere, and it kinda (maybe) made him traumatized. 🤔 But yeah surprise me like you always do J. <br><br>3. Hope Dobby get the amount of patience as much as I had when I read Dodam Shipwar. 😂<br><br>Stay safe too J ☺️🧡

      hii jhour!! i’ve never written in ur cc before but i suddenly wanted to tonight hehe so this is probably gonna be long and a lil //cringe//. i was your 888th follower, i remember cus i’d never got intrigued enough to follow an au acc before but your words had me hooked day 1, i just knew i had to follow. also i remember 888 cus in numerology its the angel number of abundance and good vibes in general, so might i say i thought it was [fate] lol best believe my spiritual ass always wanted to let you know that. Your acc has only being growing ever since then and i know we’re technically strangers but im so so so genuinely proud of you, you’re so strong and beautiful, you make healing look easy ( and trust me i know it’s not). On a lighter note, *eye roll alert* i do have a crush on you (like almost half ur readers do)  hehe but its more bc of your works (?) like i ACTUALLY fell in love with your words that i cant help but have a lil teenie meenie crush on the author from whose mind the words were strung so yep there’s another simp in ur cc again lol. anyway b4 you stop reading, i just wanna say, you made me fall back in love w reading miss jhour, i didn’t realise how much i missed it. i love you, i so genuinely do. must protecc jhour at ALL COSTS. always take care of yourself ily &lt;3 <br><br>this got too long and i got too much in the feels, double checking i have anon on lol kay bye &lt;33

      1. It really is a beautiful wordplay you made J! You always put the right choice of words to potray the emotion in your story. 🧡 Yeah I hope hanhan cuteness & Suk's dumb plan will make them step by  step trying to do a better communication.<br><br>2. I feel love-hate emotion toward Annoying Ji LMAO and the only one who can tame him is Suk. I notice Suk has hidden strong capability like he can do magic without wand, and seem like both Sukhoon has dark past (probably connect to eo or probably not) that made them the way they are now. 🤔<br><br>3. I hope hjw really be honest to eo instead of playing hide and seek. I'm glad dobby just let them to find their way out although he's that close to lose his sanity. 🤣<br><br>Hope you too get amazing week ahead J! ☺️🧡

      J, I finally be able to catch up with all of your updates. ☺️<br><br>1. For Jikyu, I really love this paragraph, J:<br><br>"mundane things truly are beautiful" but Jihoon wasn't mundane. He was something far too complex for his mortal self to understand that someone so fascinating and brilliant exists.<br><br>I just stop reading to inhale those words. It just bewitched me. 💫 <br><br>Jikyu really need to sit down, and talk to each other about what's inside their mind instead of jump to conclusions or running away from each other. Because everyone try hard to make them do that, inc our cutie little beanie Hanhan. <br><br>2. For Sukhoon, every chars really suit them. Sukhoon dynamic feels like severus & james dynamic. Ji is an self-absorbed brat while Suk is just cool-headed leader. Kyu being fluffy cutie whipped he is and Yoshi being selfless gorgeous boy. I hope Yoshi is gonna be fine. 💔 I hope Ji can redeem himself. <br><br>3. For hajeongwoo drabble, I literally LMAO with Dobby's ramble tweets, and all Sahi care is that frickin floor!! 🤣 It's also fun with sukhoonkyu crumbs (are you making them in triangle love or what? 😆) and also a bit of dodam crumb. And ofc it's not Jhour fics without the big A, ANGST. ☺️<br><br>That's all my rambles to you, see you in your next updates J! ☺️🧡

      Hi Jhour! This is your annoying reader D!!! I've been telling you I'll catch up on your updates but I don't think I can do that for now. It's been so stressful these days that I just want to rest but I can't since I need to do lots of things. I can't even rest for like an hour. Idk why the world's been too hard on me. It gets to the point that my family's being too harsh on me I just stay quiet and break down the whole day. But anyway, I just wanted to say that you've been a big help to me. All of your AUs made me really happy (even if you give us angst all the time)<br><br>I just want you to know that I love you so much and I'm sorry for the things I have done back then. I might leave stan twitter soon but I still don't know, maybe I'll just rest for a while. I love you miss jhour!!! See you when I come back &lt;3 I love you so much and I'll miss you🥺

      miss jhouuuuuurrr AAAAAA im gonna cryyyyyyy the jikyu au update was soooo soft and cute and it breaks my heart to imagine jihoon getting teary eyed by the sight of kyu and haneul getting all snuggly helpdhdjsj how can you find the perfect words to describe the scenes?! i really loved the line "Park Jihoon was celestial" omg omg its as if im watching a movie while readinggg ackk 😭 also im curious,, may i ask why daisies out of all the flowers? does it hold a particular meaning to you or was it just fitting for the plot and character?? anw tysm for this update miss jhourrr!! i'll be back after reading the sukhoon au!!  AAAAAA

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> awwwh ron you're always so sweet :'( and yay you noticed jihoon being emotional seeing haneul and junkyu :&lt; i loved that line too, how junkyu was just observing jihoon taking care of his daisies &lt;3<br><br>regarding the daisies, you already saw my tweet but it's cos jihoon irl tends to use white flowers with yellow center, and although not all daisies look like that, it's what they're known for :) also romy looks like that as well haha<br><br>daisies were the first bouquet i got from someone as well but i didn't really realize it until i thought about your cc. sksks so yeah basically it's all on jihoon and nothing to do with myself uwu more back stories for the daisy next update :)<br><br>thank you so much for dropping by ron!! ily

      Hi J! I really enjoy all of your one tweet fics today. They are hilarious & out of the box. 🤣 I have a hunch you gave us these one tweet crack fics, because you're gonna give a lot of angst on your ongoing long AUs, I'm excited if it's true tho. 😜 I hope after you finish the hajeongwoo spiderman drabble, the next in line will be dodam the tree. I need to see dobby as a cutie fluffy sulky tree and dodam being dumb & dumber again. 😆🧡

      Hi J! I just read your latest Jikyu update. Hanhan just being cutie squishy pumpkin munchkin he is. ☺️ But ofc our jikyu dont forget testing our patience with their childish behaviour. 🤷 The Daisies are nice touch tho.<br><br>Fun fact about Daisies (I love them as well like Ji does): Daisies simbolyze new beginning and true love because composed of two flowers that blend together to form one lasting bloom. 🌼<br><br>I hope that would be a sign for our Jikyu to start their new beginning toward true love journey. ☺️ Sorry for my rambling in the morning J. 😆🧡

      I was wondering whether you've ever faced a situation where you're writing two or more works simultaneously and had to write the same pairing with very different dynamics? Does that kind of situation cause you any trouble?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> yeah, i had to writeee uhmm sukhoon drabble (childhood friends) and hogwarts au (rivals),,, hmm haven't really stumbled upon problems with that since i think of all of them as separate characters with different backgrounds and personalities :) when you write a fic, separate the person they're based on from the characters, as sometimes we tend to think of their actual real life dynamics when we write them. also separate yourself from your other stories so as to not overlap them. it would be easier from there.

      Hi Jhour, Zodiac Anon here.<br><br>I haven’t touched the creative writing course because I have tests to take, along with digital marketing & copywriting course 😭 hopefully I’ll be able to get back to creative writing soon<br><br>I’m reading the Hogwarts AU. From my POV, Slytherin!Hyunsuk gives off Scorpionic vibe, and Gryffindor!Jihoon acts like a Leo with his dramatic ass (the irony lol). Oh, finally we have YoshiKyu brief introduction  and Iksan Boys + Jaehyuk slight appearance, I’m eagerly waiting for the other characters to show up.<br><br>As I’m writing this, Venus just entered Pisces. It’s a good time to spend your time exploring arts & crafts that you love, as Venus, a sign that symbolizes art and love, is exalted in Pisces. Maybe you’ll have new waves of writing ideas one of these days 👀<br><br>Jihoon has this game placement in his natal chart, I wonder if he’s feeling drowsy or inspired, because my watery self is feeling drowsy rn. But then again, I suspect Jihoon is an Aries Rising (tbh he exudes stronger martian energy than iKON’s Yunhyeong, who is an Aries Rising), and the 12th house Venus in Pisces may have an effect of a more vivid dream. <br><br>Talking about Venus, if you’re interested in Treasure members’ Venus, please let me know and I’ll try to explain it for you<br><br>Good night and sleep well. Happy weekend!

AAAAAAA can't wait for you to analyze the characters im so pumped &lt;3 i'll try my best to post updates this week so we could talk about it &lt;3<br><br>wait wait omg the venus entering pisces... i've just gone back to writing everyday. maybe it has something to do with that? :o aaa thanks so much for informing me. this is very interesting considering im very motivated to write these days!<br><br>What does a rising sign mean btw? sorry if i already asked you this. ive read different meanings about it but it's interesting how you could actually observe other people through it too :o i dont know what having aries rising but it's cool that you could tell if jihoon could have a possibility of having it.<br><br>OMG SDJKFHJKSDFH YES PLEASE EXPLAIN VENUS ;A; if you have time that is &lt;3 take your time replying~ i'll post this on twt too since a lot of people are interested in placements as well &lt;3<br><br>Good night Zodiac!! sorry for the very late reply :) i hope you spent your weekend well!

(HEA MF I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. thank you for bringing the simps gc together mwa u deserve the world my sugarplum. weap and simps my ogs you know who you are. im so proud a lot of you delved into content creating too. yall deserve the world ily) without them, i wouldn't have the traction i have now. <br><br>but let me tell you something, it's okay if you don't have much traction in the beginning. just remember that you want to write because you want to write for yourself. the people who would resonate with your works will follow. i guess it's good that you try to find a likeminded community too because they help so much for someone who is just starting out :)<br><br>just wanted to let you know im proud of you for having the courage to put your works out there &lt;3 fighting, anon!

      I want to give review on twt but it's too early for me to cry over an au on tl 😌 so I decided to just drop it here even you might not know who I am. 😜 I have fun reading your modern royalty aus. I feel attached to all the characters this time. Maybe because there's a few pov and you also write a short spin off for side ship. It's my most favorite au, now that you finished the dodam spin off, I feel kinda sad(?). But still, I'm looking forward to cry over your next long aus!!

      Hi miss jhour! So I was just washing dishes and randomly thought about the jikyu royalty au and suddenly im in tears sksksk the way ji threw away his whole life, came out from his comfort zone, forced himself to learn lots of new and intimidating things as future king.... all just to lose the reason he did so in the first place.... And he cant even say the journey is what matters because no the journey and the people he met along the way made everything much more painful, he couldnt leave without hurting himself and others :') damn it miss you really are the queen of angst

      Hi, it’s Zodiac Anon here. I feel better, thank you 😊 yes, I hope our loved ones are resting peacefully.<br><br>I bought an online course. Actually, I’m not good at communicating my thoughts orally, I always do better when it’s written, like making reports or making scripts for presentation. It’s like I have 100 thoughts racing at the same time and my mouth can’t keep up with my train of thoughts. Not to mention, I have the same level of “prone to overthinking” as Junkyu, I often struggled to say the right words that sometimes my brother complained about how slow I was in speaking. I feel that I need to sort out some of my thoughts, and your works tempted me to learn about making engaging narration. Well, just like you, I haven’t moved that much from the start 😂 I’ll get back to it soon<br><br>Aww I’m sad that you discontinued the AU :( However, I respect your decision. I hope you’ll pick up another myth story in the future.<br><br>About another AU I want to analyze: sukhoon hogwarts AU sounds interesting, especially bcs you made suk a Slytherin, as I wouldn’t imagine irl suk to be a Slytherin 😂 I also love mystery and fantasy stories, so I’m excited for this AU to come to fruition.<br><br>Lastly, I want to congratulate your boy Jihoon. He came from a long way to finally be able to showcase his talent to the world 🥺 Seems like Pisces season will always be the special season for him as a Pisces guy. <br><br>Thanks for replying my long ccs. I hope you’re having a great day!

      Hello! Quick question from what I've gathered you seem to write every update the day you post them? Or are they written already and you just screenshot and post it? Like I know some authors write the whole story and just release it as timed. Kinda a dumb question and it's all over the place but ultimately: Do you write each update from scratch the day you post them?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> ..ahaha you got me. yeah i write the updates from scratch the same day cos im too busy irl to write everything before posting. that's why there are lots of typos and errors hehe

      That's why I love your work J! You always succeed giving raw emotion for all of your character. I think I might love this Jikyu AU if you change the tags, because I secretly love the angst in your stories. 😂 I've read your latest update and I really love Jang Hana character (she'll be missed with Gon 😢). And how cute the crush at first sight between Jikyu. I really wanna be friends with Hanhan & Ji irl. 😆 Are you planning to update Jikyu AU every day or just like usual once a week?
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> awh thank you so much :( let me tell you a secret... me too... i love adding angst... it just makes it more relatable and real i guess hahaha ;A; i love Hana sm too hehe :) i'm gonna make you all fall in love with her.<br><br>regarding the updates, im actually going for everyday/every other day updates [depending on feedback mainly quote rts] since i'm a little less busy irl these days aside from work. but we'll see we'll see :( let's hope i don't get much random headaches anymore~

      hi jihoonhour!! ^_^ i just wanna tell u i love ur works so much! tbh you inspired me to write again. i’ve always thought writing has only been a passerby for me bcos these past few months i haven’t caught even a glimpse of hope with concern to writing fics and all :/ but when i’ve read your aus it felt like ive been given a go signal to express my thoughts through writing again??? ive always had no inspiration in the past so i’ve always told myself writing would never be a part of me in the future... it has always been as if i was forcing myself to do something i think is right yet at the same time, that isnt for me..? yeah something like that. but it was like the spirit within me woke up from its slumber when i’ve read your works. and that’s when i realized i could be more as well, just like you. i know you’re not a minor anymore but there was something within your works which has told me that it doesn’t mean i’m still young i can’t write anymore... all bcos of your works this is why i read your works a lot. 😭 i’ve always wanted to be an author because being able to live in your own thoughts has always been my biggest dream. telling you you’re a good writer would be an understatement bcos you’ve changed my point of view in writing. thank you so much for sharing your abilities to everyone!! 🥺❤️ no wonder the world’s a better place now bcos of you guys. stay safe always and healthy jihoon loves u!!
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hello anon! aaa thank you so much for reading my works.<br><br>i'm really glad you decided to go back into writing because of them as that was the sole purpose as to why i write, to inspire my readers through my characters and writing for whatever lesson you would want to pick up from them. i just want to tell you to take your time thinking things through :D like you said, you're still young~ there's so much more you can learn and ponder on before taking your next steps. i dont know if you knew, but i actually went into a five year writing hiatus before going back to writing. so yes, sometimes it does take some time for us to decide on things and still, we can get good results. i'm not saying, don't pursue it now but i want you to take a deep breath and not force yourself to dive almost immediately as it may overwhelm you. baby steps, okay? :) <br><br>writing is truly incredible, for us to able to express ourselves in worlds we create and how it helps us release emotions we tend to keep for ourselves. i hope you find it as enjoyable as you did before now that you've decided to come back to it. <br><br>best of wishes anon! stay safe and take care as well &lt;3

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> i might actually change the tags soon. since if you've followed my works, i tend to want to capture true raw human emotions regardless if the au is humor n crack.

      Hello jhour, zodiac anon here. Sorry for me going mia for months. I’ve been, well, sorta thrown into chaos. I got laid off from my job, and three of my family members passed away in the span of 1 month, so I need to take care of family matters first. I heard you also lose a dear friend, I’m so sorry for your loss, may your friend’s soul rest peacefully.<br><br>I want to give you a salute for your effort to write, how you take planning works and building worlds carefully, how you want to write more things in order to honor your friend’s legacy. In fact, I decided to take a course at creative writing because of your work, so I want to say thank you for inspiring me to acquire new knowledge.<br><br>I just came back from the dead, and I saw that you’re thinking of dropping one of your stories. I hope you’ll extend the time, because I haven’t even started reading it 🥺 I’m actually interested in myths, so reading the bomb hurts me 😭 <br><br>Anyway, I want to answer the last cc (which I think you would’ve forgotten at this point hahaha). I’m not confident enough to do personal consultation, mainly because I haven’t delved deeply into astrology by learning from teachers. I can only share little bits of information I know 😅 Anyway, since astrology is also related to myth, I’m gonna read your AU and try to analyze some stuff there haha. <br><br>Sorry for the long ass message.  I hope you have a lovely day today!
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> zodiac :( again, my sincerest apologies and condolences for everything that happened to you. we already talked about this and i don't want to you to revisit something you don't want to. i hope you're doing relatively better now but please take your time to grieve and recover from the loss. thank you so much as well. i hope our loved ones are happy and peaceful right now.<br><br>regarding my works; thank you so much :( and omg what creative writing course are you taking right now? online? i actually bought writing courses as well but haven't really gone back to them cos im very busy. it's good that you're learning new things too~ <br><br>sadly i still decided to discontinue it in the end :( i hope i could pick it up again in the future though so we could talk about it!!<br><br>last cc: oh okay okay~ :D thank you so much for still answering this though! sksks which AU will you analyze? aaa omg Legends will be discontinued nooooo ;A; <br><br>i always love long messages u don't have to apologize for it &gt;:( rawr hehehe hope you're enjoying your weekend!

      I'm honestly so mad that people are sleeping on your masterpiece 😭 Do they not understand that the plot for it is just so immaculate??? The way you wrote the first few updates already paved way to so much possibilities for the plot and we haven't even seen Treasure killing bad guys yet. I hope you decide to continue it but if you don't then I'll support your other works because you are still the best author out there. Thank you so much for sharing your writings with us, authornim!

      jhourrrrr continue writing the legendary au, I want to know more about the mythologies and many things about them. I think that will give me more knowledge about myths. And the characters, omg the members suits their character. Even though 4 of them are revealed, I still think that they suit the character. I'm sure that after reading your legendary au many of us, teumes, will have knowledge about them. Please don't stop, I get sad when one of my fave au writers discontinued their own au☹️☹️

I need u to know that each of ur work are inspiring and always made me travel to other universe in my mind.

      Hi miss jhour i haven't been here for long, recently followed you during jikyu royalty au. I was sold, immediately became a fan of your writing until now. The reason? Because of your world building. I was amazed how you connect the royalty setting with the modern world, how normal everything seems to be. It's like I was there and thought oh this is normal yeah totally that happens. Their dialogues, narrations, how things were explained. Your writing is how I aspire to write one day :)<br><br>When you started Legends, I was totally thrilled. I remembered you tweeting about world building being your specialty(?) and I was like yeah miss jhour I'm totally in this ride. It sadden me to know that not a lot of people is interested in the story, because I personally had been enjoying it so far. Still thrilled for the updates. World building is something I've always wanted to learn because I'm terrible in that area and following legends.... I sense something big coming and I WANT TO KNOW IT PLEASE<br><br>I don't know anything about methodology, but I'm willing to learn 🥺 please I want to see what happen or I won't be able to sleep peacefully knowing that a possible masterpiece was buried because ppl r dumb (no offense) to sleep on it :'(

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> Hi anon! :) awh thank you so much. i put a lot of thought into writing the modern royalty au so the readers could understand how it molds in our current society. im so happy you noticed and appreciated how it was told :) <br><br>legends actually has imo the best plot progression in my aus since it tackles a lot of different aspects of ot12 and their powers, numerous conflicts etc. of course there are a lot of big things coming for them and it really is saddening how this story may not see the light of day (or maybe in the future we'll see).<br><br>thank you so much for being one of the few people who supported it but, sadly, i decided to discontinue this work. i'm still open to the idea of revamping it in the future but we'll see :) thank you again, anon! let's hope a lot of fantasy fans find me so we can talk and discuss it again.

I dont know about others but this period is actually hell month for tertiary education/unis in my country so that may be a factor? Idk.

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> awwh thank you so much~ ;A; i don't think i actually answered this thoroughly before but most of my inspiration comes from my thoughts especially when i learn something new through my experiences. <br><br>a lot of my characters are based off of people important to me (junkyu from modern royalty was based off of my ex who learned and researched how to deal with my anxiety attacks, gon from bbgb is based from my closest friend in uni who acted like an older brother etc,) a lot of lines written in my works are said to me in verbatim too, (e.g, "solace doesn't have to take the form of vices"-mashikyu drabble, "i proved to myself that i could love someone unconditionally without getting anything in return"-to all the boys). i guess being surrounded by people with such profound, beautiful souls makes me want to write these lessons and experiences and share them so others can take something from them as well :)<br><br>my inspiration for the plots are rather different, that comes from my creative side. but characterization are things i picked up through observation as i grew up :) that's why they feel so raw and human, because they're based from real people who's been hurt, made mistakes, grew, and learned from them. <br><br>Happy valentines, anon!! :) hope you're enjoying yours too

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> welp, i just want to put it out there that i never took any writing courses back in uni and highschool as i leaned more towards science and engineering,, so please take these tips with a grain of salt and just know it's from a perspective of a writer who writes for leisure.<br><br>story line: first step for me is to always plan the plot. what's the setting? who are the characters? what's the main conflict and how will they resolve it? what will happen for each chapter? make your characters relatable, or if they're not, let them have complex characterization. flaws make them human, it makes your readers connect to them more.<br><br>and for the writing style, just do you :) personally, my flow is just my train of thoughts. i write what i'd feel the characters would say. if they're a teenager, write how a teenager would speak. keep it simple. you don't have to use big or complex words just to make it seem deeper than it really is. sometimes it makes the writing tacky and the flow out of place. experiment with similes and metaphors, play with your words, even a combination of simple words can make beautiful sentences :D<br><br>i hope that helped~ just drop by my ccs again if you have any more questions.

      we need to use rujeongwoo only if typing in hangul, since the romanised spellings are different (hajeongwoo vs ha jung woo), so it doesn't mess with the searches. we can continue using hajeongwoo when typing in english. we'd only decided to change the hangul to rujeongwoo. but ig a lot of teumes got confused

      How are you managing your time with all the completed and ongoing stories you've written and personal life even to extent to your work life? I mean for me it will takes a lot of time to write those stories given the structure and plot are great. I hope you're genuinely happy :)

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> i was supposed to answer this earlier saying, "you make time for the things you love," but i realized it doesn't always work that way and most of the time it boils down to energy levels.<br><br>my 9 to 5 is pretty much set on my schedule, so the remaining hours after my work, i have a choice whether i could take some rest&interact [or] write an update. i can't do all of them in a day. my body just refuses to sksks<br><br>which is why i dont update as much these weeks because im not mentally and emotionally at my best. ive been in and out of hiatus for around three months, because as much as i want to, i [need] to talk to people right now. back when i still posted consistently everyday, i only got to interact with my readers during the weekends because id always fall asleep right after updating. im trying to balance that these days too because i want to show how grateful i am of you guys.<br><br>yes, writing takes a lot of time. it takes me around 1-2 hours to write an update when im in the zone and it extends to four hours when i get distracted by other things. sometimes i even write updates on the spot sksks so when i do update my day is just work-write-post-sleep. <br><br>i was happy because i liked making content and i get to inspire other people through my works. n that was good enough for me :) it's not a balanced thing to do,, i know that now.<br><br>i just want to let u guys know that it's ok to take breaks. just because you're not doing it doesn't mean you don't love that hobby any less (whether it be supporting your kpop groups, reading, gaming etc.)<br><br>take your time and do things at your own pace. i promise you that going back to it in a better mental state is worth it :)

      You know what I forgot to add on top of the Mashi/Asahi theory I saw somewhere about Dionysus being able to turn into a lion so actualy Jaehyuk could be a possible vessel for Dionysus as well. LOL I should be studying for my exams but I'm invested in making theories and assumptions HAHA

      Answering on why I think Mashi and Asahi are said god's vessel hehe. For Mashiho despite him being not as scary and intimidating looking, I feel like if you were to piss him off, him angry is going to be intimidatingly scary and destructive especially if you get on his bad side. He probably won't be as bloodlust as the god he is a vessel of but definitely someone you do not want to wrongly interfere with.<br><br>And then for Asahi on him being Aphrodite's vessel. Something about him just exudes beautiful aura that's irresistible. Also Aphrodite is associated with roses and I got reminded of his scene in ILY MV where he is in the flower field with red roses/flowers. I can also see him as Dionysus vessel for the reason of him being the god of ritual madness, hence Asahi's chaotic energy sometimes lol. That's just some of my thoughts and theories :) hopefully you like them hehe
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> oh,, i didn't just like your theories :) :) i loved reading through them! thank you so much for taking your time analyzing the future characters and the trailer. i did leave some hints in the video and it's so fascinating how you picked up some of the things i put in there, although subtly. im not gonna say which as to not spoil you, but you did get some of them especially about the god's powers and symbolisms.<br><br>thank again for dropping by~ looking forward to knowing your thoughts on future updates

      Jhr, thank you for the new jikyu fluff prompt. To be honest, the message on the tags made me cry.<br><br>I just want to share something. I've lost a brother a few years back due to illness. It was hard on everyone. Even when we had already expecting it for a few weeks before since the doctor already told us.<br><br>The pain never went away completely. There are days when I went to sleep and woke up with my mind full of 'what if's and 'if only's. But out of the pain of remembering, I put forward more positive mindset forward. So whenever I had the question of 'what if', I turn it to reality with the people around me.<br><br>"What if we knew earlier and can actually cure him?" - I'll ask my family about their health today<br><br>"If only I told him more of how much I love and appreciate him" - I'll tell my family and friends that I love and appreciate them today.<br><br>I'll never forget him. He will always be in my prayers and thoughts. But now, I'll take care of those around me more.<br><br>I was a selfish person before, only thought of myself. But since he passed away, my family had gotten so much closer. I promised to myself, to be the best daughter, sister and friend. So I'll have no more regret.<br><br>Sorry.. I just want to share this. Sorry if I made you uncomfortable. Just want you to know, there is nothing wrong with remembering. Cry if you want. Remember the good times you had. And appreciate your family and friends more. Then the pain will be lessen by the beauty of love around you.

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> Hi anon :) <br><br>reading your cc made me think if i actually ghost wrote this. of course, our circumstances are different but there were a lot of similarities; the illness, the grief, the expectations and what ifs. <br><br>my heart goes out to you and your family and i just want to say i'm so proud of you for being so strong. i can't imagine losing someone so close to me, yet here i am. and there you are, strong despite the things life brought unto you. i couldn't help but cry reading your cc earlier, because i resonated with you a lot, especially the part where you try to put on a positive mindset so you could focus on those who need you right now. <br><br>thank you so much for dropping by and telling me your story, especially sharing how to turn thoughts into lighter more positive ones because i really needed it. you don't have to apologize :) it's okay, and i actually really appreciate your cc so i want to thank you for it. <br><br>the message on the au tag is actually for my goddaughter, whom i serve as primary godmother :) standing in as her second mom should events like this happen. the thought of raising her with her mother's memories is something that keeps me going right now, and i guess through her my bestfriend's legacy could be passed on. <br><br>she's such a ball of sunshine and i love her so much. i still cry when i think of the future but i know she'll look after me, her family, and her daughter. <br><br>thank you so much again for dropping by and thank you for reminding me that healing and love will always be there waiting patiently :)

      hey i’ve been following you for a long time and would just like to say that i’m really sorry about your loss.. i can’t imagine what it must feel like to go through this, and even more unfathomable is the sheer strength of your spirit to reflect such love and light despite all that you are going through. i was worried when you deactivated and am glad you are back; i hope you always remember to take care of yourself. 💫
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hi! thank you so much for the kind words :) <br><br>the past few days i saw that people deal with grief differently. not everyone cries, at least not in front of others. and i found that writing and reflecting what i feel personally helped me a lot. what might work for me might not work for a lot of people, and it's fine. It's fine because at the end of the day you still get to keep their memories with you :) especially happy ones.<br><br>it's hard, yes. the pain doesn't go away immediately, i don't think it ever will. but accepting is part of healing :D<br><br>thank you again and please take care too :)

      jihoonhour, dear, your soul is beautiful :) your passion in writing is unmatchable. very hardworking. when i cry over an au, i think it's a talent right? to be able to make people feel the emotions you want them to feel... not all writers can pull it off. and you, i found it in you. lol this is longer than i intended but all i wanted to say is that you are an effective writer! don't stop writing. you have so much to give and i can't wait to see that in the future. healthy living🤘

      The story was titled The Mystique. It was written by user mashimellowjam but last updated on 24 July. I am still patiently waiting for updates. It's about a group of people that have different type of power as and it was told in the legends for generations. There are those who tried to kill them to collect their eyes because that is how the power can be reap and kept. But mashi x junkyu power in that story was just....unbelievable..<br><br>I am also still patiently waiting for updates on BIRTHRIGHT au by kenainot x shibajinus (in case they read this).<br><br>Happy New Year!

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> ah, i didn't discuss this thoroughly too so i'll elaborate here :)<br><br>so first of all, i'll put this:<br><br>Late Prince Sanghoon x Mrs. Choi = Hyunsuk<br><br>King Sungho x Queen Nari = the kims<br><br>sanghoon and sungho are siblings, born of the late king. the king (junkyu and hyunsuk's grandfather) and sanghoon, his first child, were assassinated sixteen years prior to the original timeline, making sanghoon the king in hyunsuk's stead until he comes of age.<br><br>hyunsuk always knew he was betrothed to jihoon because king sungho already informed him of it when his father passed, that's why he has a baby photo of him in his wallet. the kim siblings didn't pay much attention to the name of the kid, only knowing him as "our cousin's betrothed".<br><br>however, there was a second assassination attempt which i didn't discuss thoroughly. this was around the time hyunsuk was in middle school. it specifically targeted him, the king to be, which prompted him and his mother to flee the palace. much like jihoon, for them politics was already enough and they just needed to live peacefully without threats. his previously family name, kim, now changed to his mother's which is choi. that's why they refer to him as, "their favorite choi"<br><br>him and his mother went back to Seoul, not telling anyone it was only just for a while, so he could meet his supposed fiancé, as junkyu is already of age. he just wanted to get to know jihoon, that's it. <br><br>not fall in love with him all over again.

      Jhournim, I kinda get what you were trying to deliver earlier. I've taken Cross Cultural Understanding class, and it is right thing to do to inform anyone about the culture in order to clear the things since different culture might create misunderstanding. You want the best for Jihoon thats why you said those words earlier, if he really said it we need to educate him if not, it is good then. Hopefully you are fine and still comfortable here. I love you!

      just wanna say ty for speaking up about the issue, some teumes need to remember where their priorities lies and stop taking kpop too seriously. honestly some teumes need to remember that the members need to be held accountable for what they did, stop defending them as if they are babies who never do anything wrong

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hi~ i think i've answered this before but i'll answer more elaborately here :) <br><br>for now, i don't plan on publishing any of my works professionally (i don't even know if i ever will). i don't feel like they're worth publishing as of the moment, and i feel that i need to hone my craft in writing if i ever do want to do it in the future.<br><br>my current works are not beta read, and i know i make a lot of errors in grammar and other things. my flow isn't the best and im trying to improve it still. all in all, if i want to pursue a writing career i wanna follow the proper path of investing in my knowledge in the art of writing first because i want to produce work of high quality. my readers the deserve the best after all :)<br><br>tldr; i mostly just write for fun right now and i dont think theyre worth publising, but i wanna thank you for supporting me if i do plan to publish them in the future :) at least i already have one reader with me hehe

      Hello jhour, zodiac anon here. I’m going to answer your questions, I hope you won’t be confused by my long explanations haha 😂<br><br>Yes, Leo is a fixed sign so you can identify some of the fixed sign traits in you. Regarding MBTI and astrology, it’s important to look at different perspective when you’re interpreting a person’s character, because nobody is one-dimensional. Each person has their own way of processing informations and emotions.<br><br>About compatibility, it’s actually more complicated because you have to consider their synastry and all. But if you look from the sign elements, you can see the patterns of Treasure’s dynamic. Water (Jihoon) meshes well with Earth (Hyunsuk, Junkyu, Yoshi). Fire (Mashi, Jaehyuk, Asahi, Doyoung, Haruto) get along with Air (Jeongwoo, Junghwan). Then we have Yedam, a Taurus (Earth) with Gemini stellium (Air), but since his Air placements are more prominent, he is closer to the Fire Signs and the Air Signs in the group.<br><br>Sun and Moon are important, but two people could have the same sun and moon and act differently, for example, JaeSahi. JaeSahi have the same Sun (Leo) and Moon (Virgo). They even have the same Mars (Sagittarius) and the same MBTI (INFP).  They have different Mercury placement (Jae in Cancer, Sahi in Virgo) and Venus (Jae in Gemini, Sahi in Cancer) and these placements are what makes them different in communicating and showing affections. <br><br>Jae’s Mercury in Cancer makes him a great communicator and listener. He always make others comfortable, memorizing pieces of their informations well, and sensitive to nuances of communication, but could be subjective to a fault. Asahi has Mercury in Virgo, and this makes him someone who is resourceful, reliable, and detail-oriented, but not really good at lateral thinking. Jae’s Venus in Gemini shows affection through simulations and conversations, which is why he always does skinship and communicating. He also enjoys variety and he does this by hanging out with different people. Sahi’s Venus in Cancer shows that he’s actually an affectionate guy who secretly loves sentimental gestures and cuddles. He shows love in form of protection and taking care of other people, but since he wants security, he tends to hide his needs for affection until he feels safe.<br><br>Another thing to consider the Rising Sign to determine their house placements, but I don’t know their rising signs so I can’t go into further details. Lemme know if you can absorb this informations ☺️

      Hi jhour, zodiac anon here. LMAO noo Suk isn’t lazy 😂. It’s just that fixed signs are usually slow to react, as they prefer to analyze situations first before giving responses and taking actions. Fixed signs also prefer to finish whatever things they started before moving on to the next. Stellium is when you have a cluster of three or more planets in one sign. For jihoon, his personal planets (sun, mercury, venus) are in pisces, it indicates that his life is heavily influenced by pisces traits<br><br>About MBTI, I think Jihoon’s mars in aries plays a big part in his ENTJ personality. ENTJ’s primary function is Extroverted Thinking, which is all about decision-making. Aries is a cardinal sign, they’re the initiator and also quick in taking actions, they also have leadership quality. That “ppali-ppali” habit of Jihoon? That’s an Aries trait, always rushing to quickly move on to new things. Imo, Jihoon uses his Pisces power to assess things, and then quickly makes decisions with driving force from Mars in Aries. He’s quick-witted and he’ll make decisions based on what he things is right and efficient at the moment. The manifestation of Extraverted Thinking may be a bit different from you, but essentially the thinking process is the same.<br><br>That’s an explanation from me. If you’re interested in other members’ chart, I’ll look at their charts too 😊 Oh btw, Yedam is the intuitive type too, since he has moon in pisces

Like the plot is so clean and smoothly transitioned, the description feels real and the dialog wasnt awkward at all.. i read many fanfic but yours really satisfy my craving to read(?) <br><br>Do you have any tips to write better? <br><br>Thank you i love youu
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> Hi~ thank you so much :) i think i already answered something like this before but i'll just write what my remaining braincells can;<br><br>hmm i guess aside from the plot and scene descriptions, focus on the characterization of your characters. make them relatable. make your readers hate them, but let them understand where they're coming from. flaws make them human and they let your readers connect with them. if you want a redemption arc, that would be great too. if not, that's fine. remember to treat your characters like their human and like real life, some people don't really experience character growth. <br><br>for the dialogues, imagine them talking to each other. you don't have to write proper syntax, it makes it weird especially if theyre not meant to be that way. if your character is a teenager, write how a teenager would talk. make your readers differentiate their personalities through their dialogues. <br><br>i hope that helped for building up your characters :) send me a cc again if you wanna ask about plots.<br><br>most importantly, don't just write for the sake of writing or for the sake of producing something. write for yourself and for your readers. quality over quantity :) write when you know you're in the right mindset to do so.

      Hi, Jhournim! So, I have a drama script task for my final exam. It reminds me of you. It is midnight here, I feel so tired but I only able to write one scene. I can't imagine how u able to manage your time to write since u have busy life yet the quality of your writing is high T.T I'm a big fan now. Thank you for always giving us high quality AUs, whenever u tired, take time to rest and don't force yourself, we can always wait, Jhournim! Goodnight! ^^

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hi! i don't think i actually answered this in detail before but grab some popcorn cause im bout to tell you a story.<br><br>you see, i fell into the survival show blackhole back in 2018-19. i was already stanning blackpink, listened casually to all yg groups, was still hung up with pd48, and was familiar with silverboys so it wasn't really a surprise that i watched ygtb.<br><br>i vaguely remember trying to figure out which trainees appeared in the skz survival. pretty much my bias was doyoung at this point, but then jihoon came in and i realized that he appeared in the yg vs jyp skz episode; but he was in team b. i guess it made me focus on him more because like i said, i was tryin to find the silverboys babies (which were doyoung, yedam, and jihoon), and i saw how he led team b for that go go performance. most of the time an idol's talent catches my attention first, but this time jihoon caught my attention with his initiative and drive to debut in yg despite leaving the company for a while.<br><br>the deal breaker for me was probably watching him interact with all the other trainees in ygtb's extra videos(?). i saw how everyone got along with him pretty well, how he was chosen for challenges by the others, and overall a great person to be around with. call it egotistical but i saw myself in him; my friends would often describe me as someone who can be put in a room with anyone and just make the person comfortable. that's basically him too. our personalities are so much alike it's kinda scary lmao,,, the way he teases and goofs around with others but can turn strict when he needs to,, literally me lol.<br><br>so yeah, he's been my bias since ygtb. stanned him cos i saw myself in him and his talents are literally god tier. i mean he was known as a dance line member but now he's a prominent member of the vocal line and a leader? like damn kid, god really has his favorites, huh?<br><br>i know i look like i stan him for the lulz cos he's the funny member, but i really feel like he's a comfort idol for me. i love him i really do, i just dont show it that much in twitter because im not the type of person to simp for my bias,, hahaha. i literally feel like im watching my little brother grow up from a cute lil kid to an annoying teenager lmao<br><br>regardless if he's the babie jihoon i met in ygtb or leader jihoon who i wanna fite 24/7, he will always be park jihoon, that one idol i resonate with the most. <br><br>AS FOR TREASURE, who wouldn't stan those kids after watching treasure box?? i mean come on ;A; fucking talented. each and every one of them. you'd be stupid not to stan the fucking daylights out of them after watching that show. im not invalidating post-debut teumes btw, im just saying, how can you not stan them after watching ygtb? blasphemy if you ask me.<br><br>pretty sure you didn't need that much detail but i'll be using this cc as a link if others ask me why i stan treasure and jihoon in the future :) hahaha sorry for answering so long and thanks for asking this!

      Luv u jhour!!! I'm happy that many people are discovering you and your great writing. Sad that I can't hype it up or even read it. But even if I can't read it, I know that you'll always do great in it. I already saw this coming, but I didn't expect that I can't congratulate you vocally or in my acct. Again, sorry for breaking your trust. I miss interacting with you. I miss seeing you on my tl. I miss seeing you roast anons. I miss seeing you roast Sukhoon for not updating and for being cowards. I miss your works. I miss you a lot. Please always remember that I'm always here supporting you with everything that your doing and that I'm really really happy and grateful that you're being recognized for your great writing. I know that your still disappointed for what I've done, as I am with myself too. I'm not expecting you to forgive me, but I still have a little hope that you will too, soon.

      Hello, there! I just want to say, I really like how the plot of your Jikyu AU turned out. I haven't read it until the latest update but, it's enough for me to say that. I thought the main conflict would be Jihoon clearing the misunderstanding between him and Junkyu and they would slowly fall in love with each other or something. You know, the typical enemies to lovers situation. <br><br>Which is not bad, per se. Just a bit overdone.<br><br>However, it turned out Junkyu knew about Jihoon's situation and when their conversation happened ... well, that explains a lot of things, including the way Junkyu behave. Honestly, I like his character here. I can understand why he would behave like this, or like that. If you get what I mean? Hshsh.<br><br>As someone who's very into royalty setting (I watched a lot of documentaries about the royals back then), I admire you for not romanticizing it. The politics, dramas, and all that. UGH, living in a palace is not as beautiful as the media often portrays.<br><br>Well, since I am not reading until the last update yet, for now, I'm gonna say that it seems to me Jikyu would be that "you and I against the world" type of ship here. Kind of. Which is something I'm looking forward to! If it doesn't turn out that way, then it's fine. You're great at surprising your readers, and you never disappoint.<br><br>I hope my message is not too long, lmao. Take care, Jhour. Keep writing beautifully.
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> thank you so much for the really great review~ <br><br>and yes! i do try to stray my stories away from plots that's overdone/expected (although of course it's already been tackled before, i try to put my own twist in them hsjdh)<br><br>i honestly love junkyu's character here too even though a lot of my readers don't like him,,, i just laugh cos he's literally me,,, im very in touch with my logical side and i speak like that to some people irl,, so it's funny when my readers curse at him. im glad i found someone who likes his character!<br><br>thank you so much~ i really want to surprise you with the plot but idk how surprising it will be given that political stories often go a certain direction. thank you for trusting me though :)<br><br>and it's fine really! i love long ccs hehe i just take a lot of time before i reply to them hehe. take care too!

      Jhour consider yourself lucky because I saw your zodiac anon tweet 🤪 Well in continuation of the moon sign, sukhoon’s cancer moon explains their parental role in treasure as the moon is “the mother”.  they feel fulfilled when they can be useful to others, like taking care of other people’s physical and emotional needs. <br><br>Jihoon has heavy water placement, having pisces stellium (sun, mercury, venus) and cancer moon. This makes him very sensitive, because pisces is the most sensitive zodiac sign. It also makes him very intuitive, this explains why he’s good at mafia games. Pisces work like sponges, absorbing feelings and informations. The downside is that it can be confusing for him sometimes, whether what he felt is his own feelings or other people’s feelings. A pisces’s emotions are like waves of tsunami crashing in.<br><br>Junkyu has sun in virgo. Virgos are meticulous and perfectionist. They always make sure they’re doing their job perfectly. They have a good eye on details and analytical, hence Junkyu’s habit of thinking about scientific things at night. Sometimes the need to do things properly can make them not able to relax. Their self-esteem depends on how well they do their job.<br><br>Suk’s sun is in Taurus. Taurus are are grounded and hardworking, they also constantly seeks pleasure. They’re artistic and good at planning. But because Taurus is fixed sign, it’s hard to get them to rush and move.<br><br>Anyways, another interesting piece: sukhoon’s mars are positioned at their domicile (suk: scorpio, hoon: aries). Jihoon is more impulsive, impatient, and a man of action. Hyunsuk is more secretive and strategic. Because Scorpio has double-ruler (mars-pluto) sometimes it can make the person “hides their true nature”.

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> wtf not sure if my brain is fried rn but i cant absorb everything rn hsjhs what does stellium mean and what does sun mercury venus have in common to be called that collectively? <br><br>it's weird cos i associate myself with jihoon a lot but his chart desc is exactly the opposite of me.... like lmao wtf are emotions ;A; im more of a junkyu? <br><br>do you know mbti? me and jihoon have the same type (entj) and it's very fitting for an analytical person, but idk how that works for water signs since you have to be somewhat detached with emotional connections to execute logical action steps. idk if that makes sense? but yeah i always saw him as like that too haha so it's a surprise reading that his sign is in touch with his emotional side hehe<br><br>what does a fixed sign mean and are you calling hyunsuk lazy LMAOOOOO<br><br>tag yourself im hyunsuk in the last paragraph<br><br>thanks for indulging my questions though this is really fun hsjshj

      i think your hajeongwoo soulmate death drabble might just be my healing fic. it hurt so so so much, but there was also a strange sense of closure that came with it? i think it helped me understand grief better. i find myself coming back to it so frequently. i may have talked about it before, but i really think it's worth talking about again. i still don't get how you managed to make it hurt and not hurt at the same time (also icb i'm not upset about you hurting the kids what kind of sorcery is this)<br><br>one of the best things about your writing is the extent to which the reader can connect with it, and for me, personally, this was the work that i could connect with the most. perhaps it may be because i haven't had too much experience with relationships so far, so some of the relationship-related elements that you've discussed through your works actually gave me insight on things i haven't yet experienced, more like lessons to keep in mind. that's why, although all your works are equally gratifying, this one was just... special. i think anybody who has experienced some sort of grief or loss in general can connect with it.<br><br>i genuinely love each one of your works though. never realized that reading fanfiction would be such an enriching experience :D<br><br>i used to leave qrts for your ongoing works, but i haven't been able to catch up since your jikyu royalty au began TT life has been keeping me busy lately, so i think i'll just have to binge read everything later :( when i had a little time at hand, i visited your account with the intention of starting with any one of your ongoing works, but i somehow ended up rereading the hajeongwoo au again ksfdhj (which explains this sudden urge to rant about it). when i come back and catch up on everything, i'll make sure to make up for not leaving live reviews! 🥺<br><br>TLDR; you really did something with that hajeongwoo au TT but all your works keep making me swerve so idk anymore actually (oops) ILY stay healthy muah ❤️

Their moons are the opposite with each other. Sukhoon are emotional, nurturing, and protective while junkyu is pragmatic and responsible but struggling with dealing with emotions, as he tends to brush aside the emotional aspect in order to do his duty.

      OMG~~ Your reply is so loooong!! 😭<br><br>So hi again! Thank you so much for noticing me. I'm sorry for randomly baring my soul in an anonymous CC. And I'm sorry too that this reply took so long. 😅 I really did not expect to receive an equally lengthy and honest response. You are too kind. 🥰🥰<br><br>Your words are so comforting and reassuring. They made me feel like what I do right now is totally okay, and that everything will work out eventually. 😭✊🏼 I hope I could also stitch together words that are good enough to comfort and reassure you, too. I guess let me just begin by saying, you are doing well -- in your 9 to 5 and in here as jihoonhour, writer of TREASURE fics and friend and inspiration to lots of other teumes. 🤩<br><br>Even though you say you are basically working for money and capitalism right now, I believe that what you do as an engineer serves a purpose, no matter how little, to something greater. We don't just see it yet. (Also, we need that money for K-pop merch, right? So yeah, go get that dough! 😎) <br><br>Still, I know down the line, we will both get to pursue what will make truly make us happy. No pressure! Like what you have written, we got so much time.<br><br>Okay, this is getting long again. 😬 I really had every intention to keep this short because I don't want to take too much of your time and mental energy again. Thanks again for lending me your ears last time, and this time, too. I really, really appreciate you.

      Hello, jhour-nim. I feel so sad you remove me from your second acc :( but I still follow your main acc. I think it is because I rarely interact with you so you think don't trust me enough. But, its okay tho!

      Yeah I found the thread now but, you really don’t have to put the pronouns in the bio and can keep them in the locations part because the screen reader can read it just fine <br><br>https://twitter.com/catglrllsm/status/1331803403953917952?s=21

      I don’t want to say anything to anon but I’ve seen a recent video someone posted using a screen reader and they showed that it can read the location and links just fine... that was old news. When I find the video I will send it but you don’t have to put your pronouns in your bio since the screen reader can read it just fine

      amazing update! i'm soft for these characters but the story being tagged as friends to enemies to lovers scares me : ) and i know you as a writer, so i guess here's to expecting pain?

      I came across this cc on twitter, and I couldn't agree more! This is the very reason why I like really enjoy reading your works. I also wanted to say this for the forst time I read your stories but I didn't know how to put it in words. <br><br>I don't like reading aus tbh. I hate reading make up stories about idols tbh. It somehow affect how I view the idols themsleves. So i avoided it as much as I could. That's why i was skeptical on reading one before. But Im really glad I gave your works a shot. It never dissapoints me. Every story of yours. I  can enjoy your stories wholeheartedly without changing my perspective on the boys.<br><br>Not all au authors can do that that's why im really glad i found a great writter like you.<br><br>PS: Im not into qrt works or leaving a comment most of the time and feel so sorry about that 😢<br><br>But I just wanted to let you know, like your other readers say that you are talented writter so never be discourage in writting. Your works aare very simple yet you know string to pull to make the scenes memorable and relatable to anyone. And that what hooks us to your works. <br><br>And if publishing your works crossed your mind in the future, i am one of those people who will going to by them.

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hi~ <br><br>aaa im really glad you like my writing style :( you got everything down to a t. when i write, i really want to separate the characters from the people they're based from and have their own stories to tell. basically the idols are just the visuals for the story but not exactly themselves (like fan casting). <br><br>hsjhs it's okay :) at least we got in touch through here! i wont be discouraged any time soon, not when i have you guys :) i don't think id ever reach the point of publishing my works in the future (i feel like im still lacking in many aspects as a writer) but thank you so much for that. i'll be sure to inform you when i do ;A; &lt;3

      Hi!<br><br>I've been following your work since the beginning. Yes, ever since the time you created the account because you said you think there was not enough TREASURE fics available on the internet. <br><br>But I'm afraid I have been a silent reader. <br><br>Well, till now. Now that I have gathered all courage (?) to talk to you after downing just four bottles of soju.<br><br>So first of all, I'm sorry I am a silent reader, and I'm sorry for sending a drunk message to you.<br><br>But I want you to know that I really, really appreciate you. And I am inspired by you.<br><br>You see, I graduated with a degree in journalism 5 years ago. And I work in news now. But for the last 5 years, I have not been able to write. At least not in the way that I would be really proud of my work and myself. I have been justifying my lacking self thinking that what I write is what is needed by the general public, though, not necessarily by me.<br><br>Your updates have been something I look forward to at the end of a very busy and sometimes really frustrating day.<br><br>Each of your stories are beautifully written. And they teach a lot. I think I get a better understanding of some people around me now because of your works. Thank you for writing them.<br><br>It is also comforting to know that somewhere out there, there is you who got over a long period of slump and got back to writing. I also see that you are very well-received by your readers. You really deserve it.<br><br>But honestly, sometimes, I hate you, too. And it's not your fault at all. It just happens whenever I feel the immense pressure to make my teenaged self proud of what I have grown into. (I think I am 2-3 years older than you.) A lot of times, I really feel that I am performing way, way below expectations.<br><br>I don't really hate you. I just sometimes want to be like you. Though, I know that you, too, are struggling with your own life. <br><br>I hope you are well. Or at least you get better soon. I'm sorry I could not offer more consoling words. I don't think I could even begin to understand what you are going though.<br><br>I'm also sorry for rambling and for unloading so much on you. I hope my message won't hurt you. I really don't want to hurt you because I really like you. Even though I've only known you through what you have written, I really think you are a wonderful person.<br><br>I'll try to be more open about my admiration for you.<br><br>More importantly, I will pick up the pen again.

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> hello :) im really glad you reached out to me (even when you're drunk hehe,, u got high alcohol tolerance too!!)<br><br>i don't know if you know this, but i guess we're sort of in the same shoes. im practically just working for money and capitalism at this point. months ago, i just needed a sense of self because i didn't know what was the point of my 9 to 5 when i wasn't happy with what i was doing. but im glad you still see the purpose of yours. i have high respect for journalists (my friend is one), and the amount of people you help through your work is something ive always looked up to. so just by that, i just want to say im already proud of you even though we don't know each other.<br><br>one of the reasons why i wanted to write again is because i wanted an avenue to help and inspire others as i can't do that with my current work. well, i could actually, but like i said im slaving for money and capitalism right now. i guess in that sense i envy you because your work revolves around helping other people, and although you don't feel fulfilled i want to assure you that you've touched lives one way or another. <br><br>thank you so much for the kind words. it really means a lot for someone like you whose profession is of writing to give my works compliments :( the validation you gave me with that cc is something i'll hold close to me so i just want to say im really really grateful.<br><br>and hey, it's okay. i too don't think im that good of a writer, but the amount of support i get here just keeps me going.  it's okay to feel that we've let our past selves down, but remember we got so much time in our hands to go after the things that make us happy. take it slow :) and just do baby steps. <br><br>im doing relatively well. thank you for that :) i hope you're doing great yourself.<br><br>i don't know how many times ive said thank you here but thank you again for reaching out. im certain you'll do great writing about things you're passionate about given that your cc was so well written even when drunk haha.<br><br>im already proud of you. i hope you make yourself proud as well. i love you too :) have a great day~ i'd want to read your works in the future if possible :) im sure they're amazing.

      Honestly,, I love when you give treasure character changes in your aus(idk if that makes sense) but Ig it’s nice seeing different things each au since many other writers make each member their stereotypical personality(not saying that’s a bad thing)  It makes it a lot easier to relate with what’s happening in the story <br><br>skxjxksnj idk if any of that even made sense sorry<br><br>—☁️
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> ah true, it really depends on the writer's preference. however, like the other op said, i don't really like to revolve their whole personality around a stereotypical one they're known for :) but that's for another discussion. <br><br>and yes exactly, i really want to separate my characters with their irl counterparts that's why i try my best to give them their own characterization (not necessarily completely different compared from who they are, i still try to add bits and pieces of them), because i want it to be focused on the characters and the plot :)<br><br>it did make sense don't worry. but yeah, it all boils down to the writer's preference :D im sure there are lots of great works out there in different writing styles uwu

      Your stories are my inspirations especially the Mashikyu one. It keeps me going. I love how you write them beautifully. You never failed to highlight the lessons. I am amazed by how you were able to reflect on possibilities that may happen in real life. Thank you for reminding me that life has so much to offer. To be honest, your stories brought me back to reading aus again. I appreciate you so much jhour! Thank you for existing! Thank you for sharing these masterpieces. All the love ♡ Keep writing!

      Hi, Jhour. I've been commenting your posts from time to time (though not that often), but only now I finally will give you my feedbacks for your writings. Well, to sum up, I love them all. Your write in a simple but beautiful way, making your stories to be enjoyable and can be read by a wide range of people. You focus on your characterization which makes the characters to feel complex and like real people. I love that you don't take a stereotypical trait from Treasure members and make it their whole personality, like some writers do. Keep up your good works, Jhour. Sorry I never gave a comment on the qrt before. There are ups and downs as a writer that I feel myself but I hope you will never get discouraged and quit writing. You have talented hands and mind. &lt;3

      Hi jihoonhour, I’m a new reader. I’ve read your sukhoon aus and your haruhwan and jaesahi drabble and I enjoyed it a lot, you wrote well. I just started your jikyu au, I enjoyed it so far but I’m curious, will this au have some heavy complicated political conflicts (like those in historical dramas) or the conflict will mainly center around jikyu’s relationship? Thank you for writing pretty aus :)
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> politics and their relationship go hand in hand so there will be conflicts for both. not really that complicated. i'll put it in a way that it's very understandable for the readers. thank you so much for reading my works and for the kind words :)

I really appreciate your works and I know you're having fun doing these kinds of stories. Don't think too much of us. You have a life outside twt and that's understandable.

      Aww thank you 🥺<br><br>I really love your aus and how you write each of them. The way you make every character unique (i didn't even remember that they are the babies i adore so much) and relatable is very fascinating. I think that's one of the reasons why lots of us enjoy your works.

      part 2:<br><br>- not @ swings, i.e., ex-mentor/judge, rejoining as a contestant sksjfhd let's see what happens (also mnet must be rly thankful because they get more content that'd suit their dramatic editing; you'll see what i mean if at all you end up watching the first episode i don't wanna spoil)<br><br>- wonstein: i personally really liked his performance. he has his own unique style and really adds colour to the line-up. hope he gets to make way through this competition. definitely one among my personal favourites.<br><br>also, it was really refreshing to see people attempting so many different rap styles! :0 consider mukuro's screaming rap and the likes 🥺<br><br>- sycho: his 1st round perf hasn't aired yet, but i got familiar with him through the show 'my major is hiphop'. it involved varsity rap teams/clubs battling in the name of their institution, something like that. in fact, two (?) of smtm's judges/mentors, paloalto and zion.t, along with winner's song mino (runner-up of smtm4) were some of the mentors in that show. i found him to be really impressive, not just his rap but also his presence. looking forward to see how he does!<br><br>- it'd also be nice if we get to see more of female rappers. in the history of the show,, it's EXTREMELY rare that a female gets through to the later rounds, to the point where many people are unaware that women can also participate in smtm and think that it's is a male-only competition TT female rappers are the ones who are usually targeted in the initial battle rounds as 'easier' targets, so it's harder for them to make way through the show (which is also why they're usually chucked to unpretty rapstar, which is somewhat like the female-only version of smtm)<br><br>- there are a couple of other contestants that caught my eye, but these were the ones i could suddenly think of once i started typing. i also have judging teams that i'm rooting for, but i'll tell you once i've made up my mind :D besides, we've only seen half of the acapella rap round, so there are probably a lot more that we're yet to see!<br><br>so, this turned out longer than expected i rly should stop now aaaaa thank you for entertaining my rant &gt;:(( you're the best &lt;333

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> i'll look back to this when i watch the ep :) thank you for the insights.<br><br>and it's okay~ good luck with your schedule! i hope you had an amazing week

      it has started! the first episode aired last friday, in fact. this time we actually have a dedicated subbing team for smtm9 🥺 (i remember having to wait for over a year for some of the previous seasons' subbed episodes to be available TT). they've been working really hard! adding subtitles for the rap lyrics is extremely difficult, but they're doing it all. it'll most likely be released today 🤩

      What I love about your AUs is that you I got to realize that waiting for someone deserving for our love is definitely worth it. You may experience heartache but time will come that the only thing you'll feel is love and happiness. Your AUs speaks so much about the importance of communication, patience, and trust. I just love that everytime I finished reading your AUs, I always learned something. Kudos to you jhour!

      Ever since classes start, I always feel sleepy and really exhausted without a reason. I dunno but everytime I read your AU I think I'm okay already but then when I wake up the next morning I don't feel okay again. Thank you jihoonhour for making me feel alright again even if it's just temporary. I only need your updates even if that's angst or anything. Your update is purely my happiness. I love you!

      hi jihoonhour. ily. i just wanted to say i’m so proud of you. it’s weird because even though i wasn’t as early as others to follow you, i still feel like every little victory you have is a piece of my own. i’m so happy seeing your account grow and get the recognition it deserves and i’m so so so proud of you. i’m going to be here for the rest of the journey even if i missed out a lil of the beginning! thank you again for everything.

      hello! just dropped by to say that i'm loving your au! your cliffhangers are the best istg 😭<br><br>on a side note, this theme really hits home for me. ji's family and mine were very much alike ig. being the only daughter in the family, i can relate to what it feels like when one's shielded by their family to that extent, although with good intentions. in my rebellious days, i remember doing things, staying out at night with friends, for example, mainly because i was told not to, and not so much because i actually wanted to. the feeling of guilt that followed used to eat me away though. but eventually, i grew up, and both my family and myself learnt a lot with time.<br><br>the way i see it, the characterization is on point! 🥺 i'm sooo looking forward to see how things progress!<br><br>i was wondering, just out of curiosity, how far into the au are we? are we more than halfway through?<br><br>also, how would you normally overcome writer's blocks? since you're someone who updates almost everyday, or once in two days at least, do you perhaps set daily goals for yourself when writing?<br><br>that's about it for now. have a good day!
      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> oh wow, that really is just like Jihoon's narrative. im glad you and your family settled in time. kinda the same in my account too, but i guess our families learn along the way that we can't be children forever :)<br><br>1. i was wondering, just out of curiosity, how far into the au are we? are we more than halfway through?<br><br>--yes we are :) im trying to finish it before i hit my second month in my au acc (Oct 16)<br><br>2. also, how would you normally overcome writer's blocks? <br><br>--so far i havent ran into any yet so i can't say for certain, but i make sure to write the au and drabbles in intervals to refresh my mind (eg, au update tuesday, drabble wed, au thurs) or completely just take the day off of writing<br><br>3. since you're someone who updates almost everyday, or once in two days at least, do you perhaps set daily goals for yourself when writing?<br><br>--not exactly goals, but more of,,, my mind and body feel the need to keep up with my daily routine. i have a day job and i pretty much just write and socialize after work. also i have too many ideas that i just have to write them, so i guess that's why im always writing (aside from being sort of a workaholic).<br><br>tldr; i dont have a goal,,, my mind just tells me to write<br><br>thanks so much for the support and i hope you have a great day too! :) really great questions btw

      I guess Hyunsuk just wanted someone he can call his own really. He wanted to prove smtg but in return, he wanted to make them know Jihoon is his. Jihoon being naive and innocent is what draw Hyunsuk more to him. In the end, I just want them to be happy ❤️ <br><br>PS: i hope at some point, Ji may have the power to hurt him in a way he’ll realize that he’s being dumb 😁

        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> u just know he's not jealous? final answer? haha (: it's implied that seunghun likes jihoon that's why hyunsuk's trying to steal him if you missed it. also, seunghun kissed hyunsuk's ex which is considered cheating during that time, so that's his motivation. i hope that cleared it up<br><br>im glad you also read the jihoon drabble! thanks so much :D

      <div class="reply">
        <span class="reply-header"><strong>Author's reply:</strong></span> outline the whole story first (how does it start? is there a conflict? how will it be resolved?) :) then try to find inspiration for the imagery, the setting, and the characters. for written works, word play plays an important role in keeping your readers engaged. try to use metaphors, play with the sentence structure etc. <br><br>good luck!! and i hope you find motivation in posting your stories soon :)

      Thanks! Here are the questions. Just have fun there's no wrong answers! The one thing I will say is try to be detailed as it makes it more fun to read! Okay, have fun! Make the coach as cruel as you like! (The tennis player in the scenario is Genie Bouchard, feel free to look her up before you start)<br><br>1. Where would Matt tickle Genie?<br><br>2. How can Matt make sure that Genie can not escape while he's tickling her? If he pins Genie down, how would he do it? What position would he put her in? If he doesn't pin her, what else could he do to ensure she doesn't get away?<br><br>3. How would Genie show Matt she has given up? What would she say/do?<br><br>4. Do you think Genie would beg Matt to stop tickling her or would she be too proud  to humiliate herself in such a way? If she begs, how would she beg? How would Matt react to Genie’s begging? If Genie refuses to beg, how would Matt react to this? (You can even write a bit of dialogue here between Matt and Genie if you want, entirely your choice)<br><br>5. What would Matt make Genie say/do/promise in order to stop the tickling? Do you think Genie would do as Matt asks or would she refuse? If she refuses, how would Matt react? If Genie does as Matt asks, would he stop tickling her or would he just keep tickling her?<br><br>6. How would Matt taunt Genie while he is tickling her? What would he say/do and how would he say/do it? What would Genie’s reaction to this taunting be? (Again, feel free to include dialogue if you so wish)<br><br>7. How would Genie feel to be at Matt’s mercy? How would Matt feel to have Genie at his mercy? <br><br>8. What would be Genie’s worst moment of her tickling experience? What would be Matt’s favorite moment of tickling Genie ? Try to make the two answers here different but if you can't then that's okay.<br><br>9. If another player walked in, would she help Genie get away or would she help Matt tickle her? If she helps Matt tickle Genie, what role would she play in this? <br><br>10. Genie’s mother walks in. If she walked in to see what was going on, and Matt pinned Genie down and invited the mother to come and tickle her, what would Genie’s mother do?<br><br>11. Would Matt strip Genie of any of her clothes while he is tickling her? If so, which clothes would he remove and why would he remove them?<br><br>12. Does Genie deserve her tickle torture for her behavior?

      Well I know and I hope it a happy ending ,like could see change in feeling slightly from hyunsuks side but like man it hurts to see jihoon damn u made him so innocent here like He's a must protect innocent child ....man I have been thinking , seriously like I feel bad for jihoon ,hyunsuk has his reasons but .....you feel me I'm protective over my kids ❤️✨<br><br>That was alottt but nevertheless it so innocent and pure I really like the subtleness tbh the neatness her off the scenes and the genuine graduate hyunsuk shows towards jihonn regardless of who's brother he is .... CHARMING indeed ❤️<br><br>And u might feel tired after work so rest well eat and drink water cool down then do what makes u happy✨✨✨

      It’s never too late to pursue what you love to do. Money is important to sustain one’s needs but happiness should always be put first. Wrong choices leads us to where we are supposed to be. One day you’ll look back and you’ll realize those paths lead you to the right place. I love you! 💛
